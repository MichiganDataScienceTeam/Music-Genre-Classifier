Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. It was fun for a while. There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. There's nothing.

Or the wailing of the dead. The laughing soldiers. Cast their lots. And you can cut the dread.

73,10000 Maniacs,Pop,Bent double like old beggars in sacks. Knockkneed and cursing or coughing like hags. Men marched on sleeping some without boots. Fatigue drunken deaf still to the hoots. Of breaking gas shells. Dropping softly behind. But limped on bloodshod. All went lame all went blind. Gas quick boys fumbling helmets in time. Someone still screaming a man in fire or lime. Under a grey cloud dim dark through green light. In all my dreaming before my helpless sight. He plunges at me. Choking guttering drowning. Put in a wagon he had to keep pace. As his eyes melt to his face. If you could hear blood. Gurgling from ruptured lungs. If you could witness. Vile sores on innocent tongues. You would not tell me. Not with such pride and such zest. The lies of history. Dulce et decorum est. Pro patria mori. Some desperate glory. Pro patria mori. As witness disturbs the story. Pro patria mori. Stand firm boys breathe the glory

99,12 Stones,Rock,"""We all pretend that the world's not changing. We all believe we deserve much more. But deep inside there's no denying. The rising tides have reached our shores. Get in line and set the outcome. Feed the rich and rob the poor. Tell myself that it's not worth fighting. When will we wake up?. Why can't we see there's more. To life than misery?. How can we fly when we clip our own wings?. How can we drown out all the sounds of hate. When everybody screams. """"what has this world done for me? """". We close our eyes as the kids are dying. We pull the shades and lock the doors. We all complain as we sit in silence. We cheat the game while keeping score. Get in line and set the outcome. Feed the rich and rob the poor. Tell myself that it's not worth fighting. When will we wake up?. Why can't we see there's more to life. Than misery?. How can we fly when we clip our own wings?. How can we drown out all the sounds of hate. When everybody screams. """"what has this world done for me? """". Why can't we see there's more to life. Than misery?. How can we fly when we clip our own wings?. How can we drown out all the sounds of hate. When everybody screams. """"what has this world done for me? """""""
100,12 Stones,Rock,I find myself in question again. And I doubt this Love you've given to me. I hope you understand when I say. I need this time to myself. You speak your mind to me again. You force your words so deep within. You try to tell me how to live. But it's my life. I know your open arms too well. Cause I've lost myself there many times before. I need to slowly fall away. Far from the grip you have on me. You speak your mind to me again. You force your words so deep within. You try to tell me how to live. But it's my life. I find these words were never true. I've lost all my respect for you. I need to find my own way. It's my life. I gotta get away. One step away. I gotta get away. Just one step away. I gotta away you're pushing me away. I gotta get away. Well I'm gone
101,12 Stones,Rock,There's nothing to say. At least while these clouds still lingers. And I feel ashamed. I've spent my life pointing fingers. I'll take the blame. And I'll take the weight of your world. The past will remain. The future's still wide open. Will you save me from this misery. My hate killing everything good in me. I am trying to find where I belong. A love starts to fade. It feels like the world is ending. Remember this place. Where we found a new beginning. If you take the blame. I'll take the weight of your world. The past will remain. The future's still wide open. Will you save me from this misery. My hate killing everything good in me. I am trying to find where I where I belong. Will you save me from this misery. My hate killing everything. Will you save me from this misery. My hate killing everything good in me. I am trying to find where I where I belong. Will you save me. Will you save me yeah
102,12 Stones,Rock,When I look into your eyes. I see a lot of hate. Pushing me away. You're haunted by a past. A past that brings you down. So you throw it all away. Again. Just try to find a place deep within your soul. And don't deny the child living deep inside. Open your eyes and find. This life's better than you know. It's in your hands now. Just open up your eyes. Deep inside of your mind. You're forced to believe. That nothing's gonna change. So I take you by the hand. And I lead you to a place. A place of happiness. Like this. Just try to find a place deep within your soul. And don't deny the child living deep inside. Open your eyes and find. This life's better than you know. It's in your hands now. Just open up your eyes. Don't throw it away. (2x). Just try to find a place deep within your soul. And don't deny the child living deep inside. Open your eyes and find. This life's better than you know. It's in your hands now. Just open up your eyes
103,12 Stones,Rock,Fear falls hard like rain again. Washing over me. You say nothing will ever change. What do i believe. You fall deep inside again. Nothing left to see. Weakness fills your heart again. You put it to rest. Chorus:. Forfeit everything. 'Cause you were never strong enough. Close my eyes again. And pray that i will not give up. I try to see your face again. A Photograph for me. Your voice calling out again. Nothing left for me. You try to find your place again. Waiting just to breathe. Weakness takes your heart again. You put it to rest. Locked inside again x3. Chorus x2. Did you forget about the things i said. Fight the lies inside your head. Deny those who try to bring you down. Kill the pain and emptiness. Find a love and lose yourself. Without this life you're just a memory. Locked inside again x3
104,12 Stones,Rock,Looking for light in the darkness. Is something for fools. Searching for hope in a hopeless time. But now I'm through. Because I know I have something inside. Tô keep me from stumbling over my pride. And I'm dying tô believe. But now that it went away. I thought it would end all today. And I can feel the fight. Deep inside me giving way. And I don't wanna give in. But it's getting really hard. Tô give it all away. Nothing's coming back tô me. There was once a time. When everything seemed fine. Now I'm going back again. Tô this picture perfect place of mine. I won't believe something's wrong. When I know that it's true. And I know I can't lose a thing. If there's nothing tô lose. Nothing will keep me from chasing my dreams. And I will not give up on all of these things. That I'm trying tô achieve. But now that it went away. I thought it would end all today. And I can feel the fight deep. Inside me giving way. And I don't wanna give in. But it's getting really hard. Tô give it all away. Nothing's coming back tô me. There was once a time. When everything seemed fine. Now I'm going back again. Tô this picture perfect place of mine. But now that it went away. I thought it would end all today. And I can feel the fight.

105,12 Stones,Rock,As he raises his hand you begin to understand. That no love is worth the hate that you feel. Now you're running out of pain. And all these feelings feel the same. So you close your eyes and wish it all away. And I lie awake and I try to say. Anything I know just to ease your pain. But you hide away where no one can see. And it's only you that can set you free. Now the time has come again. So you reach deep down within. To find the strength that you have buried there. As you turn to walk away you can still hear him say. You'll never make it in this world alone. You try to fight (you try to fight). You hide the pain (you hide the pain). You walk away (You walk away). Never again!
106,12 Stones,Rock,The mask you're wearing is hardly you. The lies you're preaching are nothing new. Your taste is precious. But your heart is growing cold again. The spell is tempting but your wishes seem to fold again. (your wishes seem to fold again). I've always wanted someone like you. How can i love if i hate all of you?. You disappoint me; i see right through. How can i love if i hate all of you?. You speak your visions; i see right through. Your false intentions; far from the truth. Your taste is precious. But your heart is growing cold again. The spell is tempting but your wishes seem to fold again. (your wishes seem to fold again). I've always wanted someone like you. How can i love if i hate all of you?. You disappoint me; i see right through. How can i love if i hate all of you?. My heart is coming down now. But i'm not starting over. I can't wait a moment longer. I've done the best i can. I've always wanted someone like you. How can i love if i hate all of you?. You disappoint me i see right through. How can i love if i hate all of you?
107,12 Stones,Rock,Every morning as I wake to another day. I bow my head hit my knees and I begin to pray. I search for answers that I wonder if I'll ever find. Running circles in the mazes deep inside my mind. You always take me to a higher level. Show something that's deep inside. You show me things I never knew. You push me you pull me. You set my soul on fire. You take me so much higher. Higher again. Thank you for it all. Everyday living this life not knowing what it means. Consolation from above fulfilling all my dreams. And as I look across the crowd in their eyes I see. All their troubles and their pain staring back at me. You always take me to a higher level. You show me something that's deep inside. You show me things I never knew. You push me you pull me. You always give the best for me. Lift your hands high right where I can see. You always give the best for me. Lift your hands high right where I can see
108,12 Stones,Rock,Say you love and hate me. As you desecrate me. Break me down with a smile. Feel it creeping closer. The rich taking over. You're out for blood with fire in your lungs. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive. Swear I hate to do this. With the same excuses. Anger swallows me whole. You feel it creeping closer. The rich taking over. You're out for blood with fire in your lungs. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive
109,12 Stones,Rock,I'm sorry for needing you to carry me. So simple sometimes when you're standing next. To me. You never change you never stay the same. Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with. One last song to sing. Take it all away from me and tell me how you. Want this to be. I want you i need you. A life without you made me wonder why i'm here. Until i found nothing ever seemed so clear. You never change you never stay the same. Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with. One last song to sing. I lose myself in everything you say i lose myself. In everything. I never knew that i could feel this way i never. Knew that i could feel
110,12 Stones,Rock,Time is never on your side. We must keep moving. We walk through this life so paralyzed. Our past will shake our future. The path that we choose is all our own. But only time will tell. We stand and fight. We hold the line. We chose our side. We won't compromise. If you fear the cost. The true time you lost. You're destined to fade. And you're waiting for something to change. Time is never on your side. We must keep moving. Before we fade into oblivion. If our fears and hate keep growing. We'll never shift the paradigm. But only time will tell. We stand and fight. We hold the line. We chose our side. We won't compromise. If you fear the cost. The true time you lost. You're destined to fade. And you're waiting for something to change. Underneath it all. What have we become. Will we rise or will we fall. Only time will tell. We stand and fight. We hold the line. We chose our side. We won't compromise. If you fear the cost. The true time you've lost. You're destined to fade. And you're waiting for something to change
111,12 Stones,Rock,We walk alone. In the unknown. We live to win another victory. We are the young. Dying sons. We live to change the face of history. So be afraid. It's the price we pay. The only easy day was yesterday. So hear our voice. We have a choice. It's time to face it. We are one. We are one. We are one. We will stand together. Number one. Number one. The chosen ones. We are one. We are one. We will fight forever. We are one and we won't die young. We are the bold. United souls. We live to win another victory. Our sacred scars. Show who we are. And tell the story of our memories. Don't be afraid. It's the price we pay. The only easy day was yesterday. So hear our voice. We have a choice. It's time to face it. We are one. We are one. We are one. We will stand together. Number one. Number one. The chosen ones. We are one. We are one. We will fight forever. We are one and we won't die young. We walk alone. In the unknown.

We are one and we won't die young
112,12 Stones,Rock,I never meant to be your favorite enemy. I didn't want it this way. Face-to-face we'll finally find a remedy. As our worlds collide tonight. You'll never take the heart that beats inside of me. You don't have what it takes. It's safe to say there's gonna be a price to pay. When our worlds collide. The disguise you hide behind. Won't save you now. So let's fuel the fire. And burn it to the ground. As our worlds collide. Trip the wire. The sky comes crashing down. When our worlds collide. This cloud won't always hover over me. I've got a new obsession. It takes a fight to see who you're supposed to be. And now our worlds collide. The disguise you hide behind. Won't save you now. So let's fuel the fire. And burn it to the ground. As our worlds collide. Trip the wire. The sky comes crashing down. When our worlds collide
113,311,Rock,Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m home again. Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m whole again. Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m young again. Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m fun again. However far away I will always love you. However long I stay I will always love you. Whatever words I say. I will always love you I will always love you. Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m free again. Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m clean again. However far away I will always love you. However long I stay I will always love you. Whatever words I say. I will always love you I will always love you
114,311,Rock,Stranger flowers yet. There will never come a day that will ever regret. The hours days years and the minutes. The joy the pain the sunshine and rain in it. The drives on the coast to nowhere. Nothing to say just sit and stare. There's nothing like the comfort of a silence that's comfortable. Not talking small just skip the bull. Then I find myself in servility. Didn't think that was my ability. I go a yard and a mile to make you smile. But then I'm happy see. I got so many ways to make your gaze elliptical. Got a ways to go future's so. Criptical and I'm glad. Just another many things we've had. It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me. The first thing that you see. My eyes open I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me. The day starts carefully. On the sidewalk with the dog. You're right last night I was a hog. Come on I'm sorry. It's 73 degrees. January easily glides. Stranger flowers still. If you're gonna wanna go another day I will. Like this make it a deal. Sealed with a kiss. Sealed with a fell of impermanent bliss. Today my love we shall let the world slide. Turn off the ringer and just glide. For we shall never be youger again than. What do you see. It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me. The first thing that you see. My eyes open I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me. The day starts carefully. On the sidewalk with the dog. You're right last night I was a hog. Come on I'm sorry. Holiday on the radio. Billie knows that is the way to go. A place where we both can spend out saved time. Not collecting interest. Maybe the same reason we always find ourselved home bound. I've got to do some homework. The leave response we want to leave Wisconsin. For a new life a new trailer with an antenna and a porch. Of course we'll bring the dog. .
115,311,Rock,Watching the ice melt between us. Just faster than grass grows. ItÃ­s not the best that weÃ­ve seen us. But nothing else I'd have chose. Reminds me of a time. When anything could have come. Anything could have happened. What a fantastic feeling. Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didn't miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didnÃ­t miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. When you fight to resist. Emotion with a fist. An irresistible force will always. Prevail. The fortress goes crumbling down. Around you where you stand. What was once strong mortar. Is now a pile of sand. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that IÃ­m careful now. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now. From reckless to recluse. And sometimes back again. Left wondering what's the use. Of a life of mischief spent. Makes cool the desert sun. The piece of mind that you gave me. Absolve me for things I've done. Only that can save me. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didnÃ­t miss. IÃ­ve dodged so many bullets that IÃ­m careful now.

117,311,Rock,Eu pensei na minha cena hoje. E eu finalmente decorei as palavras para dizer. A verdade esta me cornando como uma faca. Vou usar-la para cortar o meu conflito. A grama e verde e o ceu e azil. Minha cabeca esta limpa e meus pensamentos sao verdadeiros. Chamando o novo e velho. Nos temos algo que nao pode ser vendido. O tempo que dura para subir. No verao do amor. E o verao. E o verao. E o verao do amor eu digo. E o verao. E o verao. E o verao do amor eu digo. E o verao. E o verao. E o verao do amor eu digo. E o verao. E o verao. E o verao do amor eu digo. Eu acordo todo dia para o sol. E e dificil escolher o que fazer para se divertir. Uma boa palavra de cerca. E meu irmao e minha irma amor e sempre de graca. Vc sabia que eu esperei minha vida toda. So para mostrar o que tem dentro de mim e deixar o meu amor correr. E isto que eu estou dizendo. Chamando o novo e velho. Nos temos algo que nao pode ser vendido. O tempo que dura para subir. No verao do amor. E o verao. E o verao. E o verao do amor eu digo. E o verao. E o verao. E o verao do amor eu digo. E o verao.

119,311,Rock,Nod your head to this as a lot of apprentice. Some of this were standing on the shoulder of giants. Some tryants some benevolent. To the followers it's relevant. The rest get bent on lending opinions. I'm sending to a brand new level. I revel in completion delition of suckers. Getting served like Smuckers Jam. Fool know rules but the rest keep bouncing back. With the lack of further adieu see. As one can deduce we. Slam the shit out hard and long. Cuz we got more song. Something you might like now. All-star bound. Yeah your so sound. Cool as the blue water all around. From a force field flashing. Aliens are sending. Black evolutions of love you are hearing. The dark supernatural is the world we call. Our own home lightning in the mind comes out in song. But we're wild they say never trust us we're shady. In lieu of the crew your into we are baby. Cuz music will be coming out the words we speak. We erect breakbeats shatter wax still on the platter. Our shit is badder we come fly then we scatter. Cuz we deep and we solid yeah we hear ya holler. Electricity running through the soul it feels good. Some time the only thing that really ever could. Feed that hunger I crave it I love it I gave it. I shove it in a battery and save it for later. A waiter in the Dorothy Pavilion in '89. I met some wierdos and had myself a real good time. Downtown L.A. is a soul graveyard. Where you got to be hard or get jacked. It lacked a certain sense of something. Something basic no karm int he least I broke east. You know I had to face it. I guess I flaked but it was no mistake because. 311's got the boom. My mic check is giving me. Electric company. I can't see the high wide sky. Or stars above me. Are you a flower. Or more like a high rise tower. If so the soul of sweet delight. On you will shower. There's a place for us they say is somewhere. Not a dream but a place and you will be there. Your slippin' but content because your spirit. And hills are alive with the sound of music. .
120,311,Rock,It is a gift I know. A moment of bliss that we hold. A firecracker flash of light then on. To the next plane soul remain. Come along if you dare. It's gonna be that you're scared. Lovely life I thank you. For the reason to see the pain through. Light a candle for the dead. The wick is burning returning what we have. It's who we are. We'll reach you if you're beyond the furthest star. Don't give up the fight to stay alive and even if. you have to. Find the reason of another's pain if they lose you. If not for your self then those around who care. like I do. One day you'll see the clear blue. Beyond the Gray Sky. Light a candle.... The wick.... It's who we are.... One day youÃ­ll see the clear blue. Beyond the Gray Sky. I can't believe you didnÃ­t call. What made you want to end it all. Wasn't there something I should have tried. To help you see beyond the gray sky. .
121,311,Rock,There are days I wanna leave LA. I wanna break out the maze. Escape the dark haze these days. So many kids I know your feelin' crazed. Crave material thangs and makin' slave wages. Baggy pockets only got laundry fluff. Livin' where rich people always buyin' some stuff. So you try to act tough and hide whats inside. Hold your head high gettin' fucked up and throwin' dice. As bad as yours and bad enough I'm sure. My heart wants to love but must navigate through war. Cuz seein' that we're wired to short circuit. Must mean the meek who will inherit the earth already work it. There's a land by the sand grab the money. Plastic the life end of the century. People actin' fake can't see the omens. Wake up yourself cause change is comin'. There's a land by the sand grab the money. Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy. And everybody starts to peep around corners. Before they take their next step they know their borders. In this $19.98 plus shipping and handling type. Netherworld everytime merchandise dips in our coffers. We buy that image that cost of livin' uh huh. The fakest shit and act cool our friends are watchin'. Attention shoppers check the selection in our reflection. Don't you feel good does it enhance your fresh complexion. You gotta have it you got got to have it (2x). As the world turns and all the money we burn. On the bullshit to make us happy sometimes we never learn. We're self centered we think were better. We look down as a people upon our elders. There's a land by the sand grab the money. Now let go of it cause it's dissolving. It created all your fears and kept you hustling. Made you sever all the ties to your family. There's a land by the sand grad the money. Plastic the life end of the century. People actin' fake can't see the omens. Wake up yourself cause change is comin'. There's a land by the sand grab the money. Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy. And everybody starts to peep around corners. Before they take their next step they know their borders.

123,311,Rock,I want the words. something you havenâ€™t heard. will I find them and. will I have what it takes to say them. in the world beside. this one there are no lies and. no suspicion. only dreams without end. You gotta feel what I mean. Look into my eyes and know. Iâ€™m trying to come clean. But I stumble every time. And then the words they escape. fail to take shape. Itâ€™s all in the code now (come again). Feel what I mean. Look into my eyes and know. Iâ€™m trying to come clean. But I stumble every time. And then the words they escape. fail to take shape. Itâ€™s all in the code now. Will you let me retract let me take it back. Sometimes my words lack and my mind flies off the track. What Iâ€™m trying to convey is miles from what I say. And you slip away. In life there are times. when nothing will rhyme. there are days I slip. when I know I should climb. breakinâ€™ the vows I swore Iâ€™d never break. a harsh word a white lie easy to mistake. where have you been. havenâ€™t you noticed. thereâ€™s no map that exists. to point us out of this. my heart was the target. it found your arrow. baby you know I want to be. your straight and narrow. I been trying to transmit a feeling. I been hoping you receive what Iâ€™m revealing. See the main thing is hang with me and relate. As we communicate watch out. Fenced in like a dog between houses. Balled up by the trouble my mouth gets. Wrapped up in the things that I donâ€™t know. donâ€™t you know. Hoping that you crack the code oh. The first to crack the code. (You may not think Iâ€™m ready to have your love again) oh oh. (You may not think Iâ€™m ready). You are the first to crack my code. I want the words. something you havenâ€™t heard. will I find them and. will I have what it takes to say them. You gotta gotta feel what I mean. Look into my eyes and know. Iâ€™m trying to come clean. But I stumble every time. And then the words they escape. fail to take shape. Itâ€™s all in the code now. Didnâ€™t I know Iâ€™m wrong wrong wrong when you knew. You didnâ€™t have to give me so long long long to see through. Not predictable what I will do but you know. Cause you cracked the code. Your body is a country. that you know Iâ€™ll return to. craving like a family heirloom. that I am into. no baby how could I follow. everything you do. just remember when we touch. I feel so renewed. The first to understand me that would be you. It canâ€™t work if we canâ€™t be open and true. The best thing to happen to me let it be told. That would be the moment that you cracked my code oh oh. The first to crack the code. (You may not think Iâ€™m ready to have your love again) oh oh. (You may not think Iâ€™m ready). You are the first to crack my code.
124,311,Rock,I wanna do what's right. Be kind to every single body. Open up to light. Just let it flow through. My body. But sometime's }. I'm unsure } (2x). I tell my baby }.

I'm unsure } (2x). I tell my baby }. There's something going on. In my heart. I feel it weigh me down. So I reach up for. Wide blue sky. Try to pull it into. The deep arc of my arms. I'm slippin' into darkness. I'm creepin' into darkness. I don't want to start this. I'm attracted to darkness.
125,311,Rock,You could lose your mind. easier than you would like to think. your best friend could up and leave you. playing tricks and cold deceive you. standing there people stare. let down by your own mind. Day of appreciation. for ways your mind has not yet let you down. the truth is that we will all go. maybe five minutes after the show. you know you are a shooting star. a blazing flash then gone. Are we advancing. or a collapsing visionary. are we really here. are we imaginary. as my thoughts separates. into the many frayed parts. torn shattered bits. my mind falling apart. Are we advancing. or a collapsing visionary. are we really here. are we imaginary. as my thoughts separates. into the many frayed parts. torn shattered bits. my mind falling apart. What if there was such a thing. what if thereâ€™s such a thing as dependence day. there's no self congratulation. just a day of appreciation. quietly humbly. for things that have not gone wrong. Imagine the frustration. of losing bearing of the simplest thing. so come with your best. and do your worst before. you canâ€™t remember what you came for. Are we advancing. or a collapsing visionary. are we really here. are we imaginary. as my thoughts separates. into the many frayed parts. torn shattered bits. my mind falling apart. Blazing out the mains. hungry flames consume all that I see. Are we advancing. or a collapsing visionary. are we really here. are we imaginary. as my thoughts separates. into the many frayed parts. torn shattered bits. my mind falling apart. Are we advancing. or a collapsing visionary. are we really here. are we imaginary. as my thoughts separates. into the many frayed parts. torn shattered bits. my mind falling apart.
126,311,Rock,Every time I get near your field of gravity. You look so sad to me tell how could that be?. ah- ah she said things I obsess. I would never confess. ah- ah I told her don’t dwell. That will leave you in hell. Sometimes things that you’re scorned for. You should be adored for. But like I told her don’t dwell. I know my love that I look dilapidated. But are you glad I made it. Can you tell me that much. ah-ah Why are you surprised. I don’t take my advice. ah-ah she told me don’t dwell. That will leave you in hell. Sometimes I need reminding. Regret is so blinding. But like I told me don’t dwell. Everything is a choice. Go ahead raise your voice. Might as well forgive your self. That means more than someone else. Set you free break the shell. To your demons farewell. (Ooh na na na na) I tell you don’t dwell
127,311,Rock,This song started as a rant against haters. But that'd be giving in to the instigators. If there is one thing I'd like to pull off. When someone steps with hate all I do is just scoff. You can't burn me (2x). The same force that flows through every circuit. The juice that's spent everytime you work it. Every life form is based on this simplicity. The soul that you have is electricity. You can't avoid that. Evolution is fact. We're all from the same Lucy. Despite differences you see. I'm in disbelief at what people will believe. All along I thought we had our hearts on our shirtsleeve. If one thing I can say as a piece of advice. Don't believe it till you see it and then see it twice. It's so funny (2x). The same force that flows through every circuit. The juice that's spent everytime you work it. Every life form is based on this simplicity. The soul that you have is electricity. You can't avoid that. Evolution is fact. We're all from the same Lucy. Despite differences you see. A call out for unity. In every province and city. What do you think we've been saying. Since we first started playing.
128,311,Rock,Music: Sexton; Lyrics: Hexum/Martinez. Talkin shit like shut up and listen to me. Because cutting through the crap is my speciality. Like a bomb I'm dropping yes a ton of lead. You're trying to figure out the last thing I said. I'm a redwood I love to be a tree yes I'm a druid. My words are flowing out like a fluid. Never give in never conform. I'll be bustin' out rhymes in a triplet form. Dead leaves on the trees in spring. Can't hear the birds sing. A light powdered snow on the ground is glistening. Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver. A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver. While I doze I suppose I could get lost. With a brownskin friend claiming kin to crazy horse. I stink of vino my greasy clothes are rancid but. I tip the bottle back the spirits are in me kid. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Whiskey be spittle at the corners of my mouth. I'm rather liquored light flickers. I got the shakes and jitters. I roll I'm like raging bull bumrushin' the show. Hand to my head sway in the fire I've waded into. All alone except for the whiskey voices. Whores laught neon signs flash other choices. I stagger stumble to toast the past while I mumble. Slur my song slow porno show marquee words crumble. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. You're hangin' around the house with all your friends. Steady drinking smoking the green weed. And head is sort of blinking. You're going with the flow. And everybody is getting plowed. The voices and the music and the noise is getting loud. You got a heavy buzz on when seven o'clock rolls around. So you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown. Only nineteen but you know where you can get it. So you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting. By about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead. You really can't remember who was the one that said. Let's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck. He's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me up. Ten minutes later the whole vibe had changed. You try for conversation. But you know you're acting strange. Your eyes are wide open but your smile is gone. You just keep fiending 'til the fucking break of dawn. Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver. A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver. While I doze I suppose.
129,311,Rock,Oh a whole new way of looking at things. The way you react to phone rings. The way it feels when you just let it flow. Sometimes I wonder just how it could be. You take every bit before we see it off the rails. I think that you should know. You never cease to amaze me. You keep me from going crazy. And that's one thing I know for sure. Sometimes I see just how it all will be. Take every bit it's so easy the first straw. And this I know for sure. (Chorus). The first straw. So small it seemed impossible. The next straw. Vanished like shooting stars that fall. The last straw. There's no reason for getting there at all. Yeah. No reason to take it there at all. Yeah. The last straw can land in your mix. Your best day could be apocalypse. Nobody pay attention to the first straw. It seems the last one is all we ever saw. The first straw's a metaphore I pick up myself. It tells me something by showing me something else. I think that you should know. Chorus. No reason to take it there at all. Yeah. Everyone reacts when it gets to the weight of breaking their back. I won't let that be us cause the long side never gave back. Yeah. Chorus x2
130,311,Rock,There was an earthquake. In her dreams so she thinks her. Foundation is crumbling away. Fault lines in her words. Hoping to show her so disturbed that. Has shaped her to what she is today. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. Sometimes when I call. She tells me things that were not her fault. And her surface starts to break. Breakdown a hurting sound. I want to tell her that it's ok now. But I'm not too sure just what to say. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. All she wants is some breathing room. If not tomorrow surely one day soon. All she wants is some breathing room. If not tomorrow surely one day soon. Excuse me did she say. She wished she went away. And not return to the shame. Brought to her those days. We'll take man's dirty deeds. And suck them out like cosmic beings. Into the sun hoping. They'll be happy burning. But life is not T.V.. Life is not T.V.. Life is not T.V.. She's on wounded knee. The wild crazy horse that's me. Her heart parts ???. I feel refreshed when I watch her sleep. Sometimes it's all I need. It's all about the company we keep. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. Getting through to her. All she wants is some breathing room. If not tomorrow surely one day soon. All she wants is some breathing room. If not tomorrow surely one day soon. If not tomorrow surely one day soon
131,311,Rock,I flip when I kick it trippin it. So I can check shit not in a daily style. But once in every while so I can. File check file check the files of my brain. Many of meaning manage to come from the insane. And the butcher the baker the fabulous drama maker. A cracker on a truck goin' breaker breaker. Listen to everyone then disregard it. The maningful shit comes back back to where it started. In your cranium surrounded by pot like a geranuim. A capital 2 burns in my mind give me some peace. I looked at her I looked at him and neither one did know. Where the wild thoughts grow check it out. I look for absolutes and there absolutely none. The truth is what you shoot for not one. Nothing brings it all together the journeys never done. I'd sing you Stormy Weather but it's been sung so. Let's have some fun. Three Eleven hass grass roots. Challenge comes and goes and there will be another. I say bring it on. The roots that grow underground are as big as the tree. That you see if not it will fall down. We waste so many moments standing on convention. The only survey is when our heart pays no attention. Move with persistence cover much distance. Knowing no perdition that's my game for instance. Three Eleven true to no tradition. And the Three Eleven crew not dow with convention. But a hundred different people already told what we about. So I make not attempt to try and suss the stupid out. I'd turned into a roughneck that was not my intention. It doesn't even really matter unless I fail to mention that. Peace to all crews that want some peace. First the Mid then the West then we slide through the East. A piece to any crew that want a peice. But peace to all crews that want peace. Check it out.
132,311,Rock,I'm all right I feel real light. I don't live a life that's uptight. Where there's fight there's struggling. I can't walk through the world. Without offering questions. What's my direction. Breakin' the grip of depression. There comes a day when you let THINGS go. There comes a time to rock a show. You know the time that you feel. THAT nothing else really matters. You're on the spot in the world. AND you belong. That's where I am when the lights going down. I'll find a way to make some fun. I know that there is a link of energy. To someone. How do you feel?. Cuz I couldn't ask for. A single thing more. How do you feel?. The moment you know. Just what you are for. I'm on a quest with a vision. I've got love and tradition. I wear a mask that grins and laughs. I remember what I've done. I'm a vibe under the sun. I penetrate all dimensions. I've come again. Rejuvenate within. I'm future animation. I feel the fuel rushing through my veins. It's a burning flame. You could take on the world. It's all in your brain. How do you feel?. Cuz I couldn't ask for. A single thing more. How do you feel?. The moment you know. Just what you are for. (bridge). How do you feel?. Cuz I couldn't ask for. A single thing more. How do you feel?. The moment you know. Just what you are for. How do you feel?. Cuz I couldn't ask for. A single thing more. How do you feel?. The moment you know. Just what you are for
133,311,Rock,There will come a time. When I no longer am. I will take my last breath. And on that day. I’ll be dying. At that time will I be at ease. Will I be dreaming and be at peace. These are things I just don’t know. Come on help me now. Why must I think of this until I find. Peace and quiet in the clouding of my mind. There were times I thought I would not come around. But I can tell things are getting ok now. What if there is no ending. And we turn from where we’ve been. To a new place where all we can see. Is light pouring in. And am I really all that far. Far removed from that ending part. With just a faint view. Of the galaxies misty heart. Why must I think of this until I find. Peace and quiet in the clouding of my mind. There were times I thought I would not come around. But I can tell things are getting ok now
134,311,Rock,Sometimes the only thing that saves you. Think of bad things luck never gave you. And although your true love has just left you. Well at least you mother kept you. Be sure that a dreams alive. There only short burst in life. Are you able to be satisfied. Do you expect fun all the time. Hey we can rock it easy and lay it in the fold. Hey we can shake you simply just by being cold. And if it falls apart will you still be my friend. Get back we're gonna stick together. And so many things that have gone wrong. At least you have ears to hear this song. And if you reading in close caption. There's still bad things that could have happened. Long time since we've first came here. And sometimes we fall on deaf ears. One thing I've got to say before sales dive. Stay positive and love your life. Hey we can rock it easy and lay it in the fold. Hey we can shake you simply just by being cold. And if it falls apart will you still be my friend. Get back we're gonna stick together.
135,311,Rock,Let the cards fall. Let the cards fall where they may. All I can do all I can say. Gotta move to trust my instincts and surrender. Let my song sing itself. I am they who admit what they don't know. All my friends excitable they'll tell you so. So let the cards fall and fall where they may. In checkin' on our conviction dick. We run from the shit our own way. So what you will so what you wish. Follow your bliss on everyday. Never ask for an advantage. Let the cards fall where they may. So let the cards fall. And fall where they please. Ask me while we're at it. I do it with ease. Taking up space is the people. Who wish to hold you back. But in reality the majority. Really don't give jack

Reminding me that no one's sane. Not all the time. Yes I still remember you. In a way that you'd want me to. I man a man you know see. Who will do right for you. Never let your regret make you wish we had not met. I cannot think that way yeah. I drove you crazy I see that plainly. You waited on pins for me. But needles never ever love. What did you think of.
137,311,Rock,I can see it now have to show you how. The funny thing is that we couldn't have it any other way. Still it kills me when we say. All we've been through. All the congs that I've sung for you. We both know I'm gonna lose you. I hate to be alone. There comes a time to reap what you've sewn. All we've been through. All the songs that I've sung for you. We both know I'm gonna lose you. Let's think of all the good times. Instead of wish we could times. So much better that way. This is what I ask for. This is what I deserve Be careful what you ask for. .

You make me feel like I’m young again. Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m fun again. However far away I will always love you. However long I stay I will always love you. Whatever words I say. I will always love you I will always love you. Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m free again. Whenever I’m alone with you. You make me feel like I’m clean again. However far away I will always love you. However long I stay I will always love you. Whatever words I say. I will always love you I will always love you
139,311,Rock,Sitting by the bedroom window. Looking at a slideshow on a Sunday but it? s Monday. Well how would I know I? d be looking out the same old window. Years later on a Monday thinking something would come from doing the same thing. Bout time to give up on the same old stuff I? m stuck on. Just say that it went wrong and move it along. Sayonara till tomorrow it? s just how it goes sometimes. You gotta keep on climbing the hill. Cuz if you think you? ll make it you will. Go swimming quick like a fish and every wish will be fulfilled. Strike up and start the parade. Cutting down the weeds keep slinging the blade. When they fire that warning shot. You? ll have a spot made in the shade. Standing at a side street station. Feeling like a one way on the down low. Flying solo till further delay. Easy blame it on procrastination. Always hoping somehow that the nonsense this time will make sense. Stuck in circles. Faces in the sunshine they never look at mine. People just walk by and keep their eyes low. Sayonara till tomorrow. That? s how it goes sometimes
140,311,Rock,I tell you what I like. This moment of unity. When there's no distance. In between you and me. I got to stop. When it becomes us and them. Need an enemy for ego to win. These are the good ole days. I don't care what they have to say. These are the good ole days. All together now. So tell me can this all be real. Find it so bizarre. Can this all be real. Hold them fingers up. Finding to a dance to be a coincidence. I don't think you got to let go of common sense. Can this all be real. Right now. Summer. Never ending summer. That's our time. We do it all the time. From Tokyo Bay to the Little Five Points. Keep on blazing a trail. Keep on rocking the joints. Summer. Here we go. Hanging out with my friends. We're traveling. Out and about. Good times that we're having it's. Harmonic bliss when we all are synchronized. Something got to see with your eyes. These are the good ole days. I don't care what they have to say. These are the good ole days. All together now. So tell me can this all be real. Find it so bizarre. Can this all be real. Hold them fingers up. Finding to a dance to be a coincidence. I don't think you got to let go of common sense. Can this all be real. Right now. Summer. Never ending summer. That's our time. We do it all the time. From Tokyo Bay to the Little Five Points. Keep on blazing a trail. Keep on rocking the joints. Summer. Here we go. Summer. Never ending summer. That's our time. We do it all the time. From Tokyo Bay to the Little Five Points.

141,311,Rock,In a minute everything you have can all be straight gone. In a minute things you though were tied can come straight undone. How about some knocks on wood some so far it's so good any day. What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out. To the north and south that's what plates are about. Nature has no conscience no kindness or ill will. The dreams they had make me sad because of the vides of them. When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened. To me and my family my bro's and I were driving. The RV bleeding flames us leaping through fire surviving. Zoned with no home there was fire all on it. Umm let me have my life I want it. I'm gonna let you know that I said. We're coming in kill we're coming chill. We've comin in how we will. Gone to tell the whole world what's the deal. And I say know no critical boarder cuz. We do what we want. Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font. Not one to get over sounding like the norm. Friendly to the radio all that shit is corn. All we coming with is a little bit of swing. And we go on like it ain't no thing. Omaha stylee did not think there was one. Where you know the radios weak and the shows are more fun. But you know we fuck up the dance since 1988. Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state. Still we're down like that x3. Makin the funk that smells of skunk. Such occasions occur back in the day. It begins you're a raw kid all the way. Son of a gun but they you drifted. All are endowed but few are gifted. At the break of dawn behaving like a spy. Lampin in the light the cold world awakens. Deeper is the light to open up the sky. Look into my eyes see the dialatin'. Omaha Stylee is the shit we come with man. Embedded in out souls it breathes out from this band We always knew. that we could. Thank you if you too felt we would. We will arise explore these worlds and find the grass roots. How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew. My dude on the one come off like Teflon. Rock your shit and you will rise on. If you're a farmer outstanding in your field say. Do as you eill do as you wish follow your bliss say. We travel round the world giving it our best. Like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest. The hammer and the chisel and the rule it compass. We forged the sword chariots of war our battle axe. There's much power in anger but loves a bigger banger. Complete props to my crew this is what we do.
142,311,Rock,Houston we have a problem. all this TV has made us dumb. anxious is what weâ€™ve become. too much prozac in our systems. itâ€™s our mental condition. itâ€™s our mental condition. one thing lacks is education. institutions fuck with our. Emotions are elastic. they stretch out and back. stretch out and back. sometimes they just snap. they donâ€™t go back. they never go back. What if it were true. that you werenâ€™t so blue. and you felt like you. could just do anything. but weâ€™re facing the sunset. and for a moment it. looks like itâ€™s rising. and we are on the other side of things. Thereâ€™s no procrastination maybe I should do it get to it straight. I see people wasting time with so much pointless debate. I canâ€™t wait for the over analytical politically correct. Upset by threats to the national mindset. I bet weâ€™d let reverse psychology mob mentality over our ecology. A college we could learn but we usually we burn and then we waste it. Taste it time and time again itâ€™s time to take your medicine. Emotions are elastic. they stretch out and back. stretch out and back. sometimes they just snap. they donâ€™t go back. they never go back.

143,311,Rock,Whoa oh prisoner. My pretty oh oh prisoner. A black ocean is the sky above. Tiny lights bob what star you from. Trapped in material plane. She wants to fly and they think she's insane. But she knows what she know. Give that girl wings and that's all she wrote. Twilight zone (2x). I'm floating in the dark alone and. Is there any love out here let me know. A laser lights pinpoints the top of my dome. Then through my body. As if Scotty's beaming up a wayward soul. Mutant races in an ancient universe. Dark shadows humans rhymin' in a raggae verse. It's gone if you blink. I can see it as soon as you think it. Dancehalls crystal balls. On sidewalk malls. Psychic people outdoors reading palms. I believe that you know more. To survive the dimension if four. Oh prisoner. My pretty oh oh prisoner. Look at the way she's searching. Trapped in a world that's hurting. So bad it makes her cry. But I won't let her say good bye. Twilight zone (2x) }. I'm floating in the dark alone and } (2x). Is there any love out here let me know }. No way (2x).

We were walkin' to my car unaware unknowin'. I stepped up crossed the the street in no hurry. And what happens next - it gets a little blurry. This chump nearly hits me in a green pintow so I threw my bottle BANG!. It broke his window. He screeched to a halt jumped out of his car. I stepped straight to him gonna make him see stars yes. The situation was going to explode. Thought I should give him a warning said ya better hit the road. I knew it would be easy if i dagged him first. So I cracked him in the face all of the sudden with a burst. I hit im with a right then a left didn't land. But he turned his head and I broke my hand. Whatcha gonna do?. Do whatcha gonna. I got a cast on my hand and the girls think I'm a jerk. I can't play my bass and I can't go to work. This is a true story it all did happen. Better yet I regret that I'm rollin' up strappin'. Been two years now since this all took place. I learn from being stupid I learn from my mistakes. And now I'm livin' peace edifyin' and trollen. Can't say it wasn't fun in those days of rollin'. Rollin'. Rollin'.

146,311,Rock,We were born in the seventies. The rippin and rhyming and brethren see. We’re filling taste great. In the old school I was eight. Fot the new school I was late. But in high school I was debate. I rate in the great state of california. I’m warning ya. Je vais a la plage parce que le guignol est chouette!. I kick nonsense in french tasty like crepe suzette. I bet you gonna wanna try this but it takes niceness. I like a beat that’s unique and I like my head zooming. And in my continental you know that shit’s booming. With the diamond int eh back suicide doors. You can look from here to eternity. And never receive your morsel.. Another tale of ordinary madness. The girl who gave you her sex I heard was homeless say. All I really wanna is to feel nirvana. Won’t you take me tonight and we just might find. A bottle of wine and feel our nasty nature. Your toung lickin’ up my tounge. Your radio pickin’ up a smokey jazz love song. Madness becomes you even though your. Livin’ life it’s hard to exist when you’re tempted. By flesh you wanna bust through. Beautiful legs in the bar there is poetry. She bends and suspends and her ass. Is a marvelous thing. A dance dancin’ at a club the hereafter. Who can’t really dance but that doesn’t really matter. And she won’t hear applause. Cus your drunk and lost. All light is gone. Your arms spread like a cross. And you’re dreaming that the world. Will soon fall apart. Topless firl in your gaze. Which is hazy. Takes your dollar. In the gutter without cigarettes. Or wine your hungover. I was warned of your normal. Behaviour and felt. My life was too short to. Consider your wack self. It’s like this when you dip down. And you are boxin’. Reeling against the ropes and you. Face some young mexican. Your scrappin’ your kneck gets. Snapped back your eyes have bled. Your thinking’ about a comeback. But your takin’ it to the head. You little bastard. Better watch you back. Cuz we’re after. Your punk ass by God we’re gonna jack it. You’re played out and small time. And your show is over. You’re ’bout as lucky as a three leaf clover. And your older ho bag sceezer. In her droopy saggy skin. Who thoughtshe was a model. But in truth a never-has-been. I’ll slap that witch as if I were her pimp. And my crew will attest to her fradulence
147,311,Rock,I? ve been humming a high note. Maybe something that I wrote. Out sailing in my boat. I? m not really sure. I? m still singing the same tune. I? ve been kicking around since June. All morning and afternoon. Now it? s all a blur. I? ve been listening to sea shells. To hear the stories that they tell. Of high times and tide swells. That have yet to occur. Backsliding down the drain. Partially taking all the blame. Chasing coins to fill the purse. Is it really better or for worse. Is it a blessing or a curse. To pass the buck. Is it a bounty or a bust. Is it precious metal or just rust. Well it seems it? s up to us. So wish us luck. I kept making a U-turn. Ended up with a sunburn. But the lesson that I learned. Was worth the skin that peeled. I climbed so many mountains. It? s not even worth counting. All the drinks in the fountain. Before it was revealed. From the copper to the kettle. The stamen to the petal. We watch the value of sand dollars crumble
148,311,Rock,If there's a scream inside of you. Just let it go. You're beating yourself up baby. Don't you know. You've got to get through. And lift the roof off your soul. It's like the pain locked. In the part of your heart. It's never gonna leave it. Unless you start. To warm it up. Be wise and be smart. Out on the ocean. There's no one around. No one to hear a sound. It's just us out here. Out on the ocean. Speaking free. Away from the city. Away from the ears that. Bug us and judge us. It's so liberating. To be free. And my heart slows down. Nice and easy. And your breathing will be pleasing. Just speak easy. And say what's on your mind. I search for something. To compare you to. Thought long and hard. For a simile true. Now I'm suddenly aware. In the quest you're beyond compare. So speak easy. If there's a shadow in your life. Then there's sunshine. Things turning inside out. All the time. Just rewind. It's all in your mind. Oh so speak easy. Out here we're floating. Late in the night. And the only light to guide us is a. Full moon that's glowing. On the sea. Nice and easy. And your breathing will be pleasing. Just speak easy. And say what's on your mind. I search for something. To compare you to. Thought long and hard. For a simile true. Now I'm suddenly aware. In the quest you're beyond compare. So speak easy. Speak easy. Speak easy. Speak easy
149,311,Rock,I am a music lover some how I get paid. This song would still exist if no money was made. That's the difference. I summed it up in a sentence. I'm sittin' here perfectly still cuz I've got no place to go. Be about two months until we light up. The show follow me now. I sing of spring it's a marvelous thing. What else swing the thing you bring. Yo I got to say hola }. Orange County to Angola }. I go back to the beat } (2x). It never lets me down }. Zone in and let it rola }. I deem stream of sweat that connects me to you. I still be all about that thing that you do. We dip dip dive and herbalize. I don't look over my shoulder but I know there are spies. But then long time crew. Stuck like glue. You never let me down. Always came through. Always kept the flow. Even when you didn't know. Don't ask us. We make it up as we go. Yo I got to say hola }. Orange county to Angola }. I go back to the beat } (2x). It never lets me down }. Zone in and let it rola }. Seems like people are the viruses. And earth is simply tired of us. So many headz what if something would give. And kill off our race. Maybe diseases from space. Arriving from a comet. With a trail left for the planet. Say the wake it created was the start of the end. Filled with spores that were engineered. Plant pathogens. What's in the future for the view is many changes. Humans could be in danger. What would you eat to be a remainder. As your food is maimed. To take you out the frame. Some would vaporize. Some would remain. The same suckers with no cares about. The wave of the world I feel. Their lives are destined for hard times too. There's a parallel universe that might be blocked. But by emotion we put into it we could unlock. I'm not saying we could escape fate tunneling in this vast. Untranslatable energy filled of dust and ash.
150,311,Rock,Massive laminate fortress. Hazy cannibus porches. Saying no to the bores. It's not mine or yours then I said. The wait sucks I don't mind waiting. Once you get here there's no more gates and I gotta say. Stealing happy hours (4x). Don't wait on minute more to ask me. You make me feel like Hank Chinaski. In war all the time war war all the time. No one else can seem to find. Stealing happy hours (4x). Stealing happy hours (4x).
151,311,Rock,No I'll not renounce my views. Do what others do. I'd rather drink the hemlock than be like you. To my soul untrue. It never gets easier. So quit tryin' pleasing her. Everything is a choice. So let me hear your voice. Born in October night. Feeling was out of sight. Skin I'm in now and then. Moves like a meteorite. Noise in our culture. Is built in our nature. Another era will decode. As we head toward rapture. Suppose we're all gifted. Suppose that the mist is. A metaphor for change. Suppose the veil will be lifted. Sacrament that I hold. Close and I feel noble. Solar marigolds light the souls. Return from that other world. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. There's so much here at stake. When every moment is just fleeting. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. It never gets easier. So quit tryin' pleasing her. Everything is a choice. So let me hear your voice. Rip up the evening post. Kill parasitic hosts. We can shoulder all the karma. That came with Los Alamos. Return the sky bottle blue. Return that forgotten hue. A looking glass world. Seeing into and through you. Soul and body are my twins. The latter will give in. When the former sees the ocean. As not too cold to get in. To alien life forms. These waters are real warm. But beware we will change the weather. And create a snowstorm. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. There's so much here at stake. When every moment is just fleeting. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. No I'll not renounce my views. Do what others do. I'd rather drink the hemlock than be like you. To my soul untrue. It never gets easier. So quit tryin' pleasing her. Everything is a choice. So let me hear your voice
152,311,Rock,Now I don't know you you don't know me }. But I can show you where's the beat } (2x). And you can do as you feel as long as you move }. Two perfect strangers sharing a groove }. Suckers step up and want to cause friction. But violence is for those who can't handle diction. Competion is waning circumnavigate the draining. Complaining about those who are steady maintaining the jam. Jump into the pit and just slam. Big respect goes out to those who can. Lose their shit once in a while. Act a fool just to mark time yo that's my style. And you can do as you feel as long as you move. Two perfect strangers sharing a groove.
153,311,Rock,Eu pensei na minha cena hoje. E eu finalmente decorei as palavras para dizer. A verdade esta me cornando como uma faca. Vou usar-la para cortar o meu conflito.

156,311,Rock,Returning from the water cold alive and shining. Rock a mic in the afterlife while your moon is rising. Heatin’ up forcing steam whirling to be seen. The dark held stars are the frost of my breathing. Swimming through the darkness I’m a ghostly shark. Developing like a photograph slowly in the dark. The hearafter the action the main attraction. One love in all of this that I’m going after. Now there’s fire inside but black space surrounds you. You think ’where oh where am i’. But even your light continues. See through us see a soul we have not yet. Learned to harness see the next world inside it. We are the people of skin who left water. Inside the dark womb inside of our mother. Prone to the beat and vibe of our tribe. We catch the drift and ride moving tides. Out from a love that will keep on burning. Now see yourself to the next world returning. This life an old place we face to live again. What is it to understand the heareafter
157,311,Rock,We could say it's just how it is. And how it always will be. And believe things will never change. As far as we can see. It's a disaster and it doesn't matter. Well I disagree. A ray of hope remains if we take the reins we'll arrive eventually. Keep all the lights on in the streets of Babylon. Then we'll just dig for some more. Pull back the curtain cuz one things for certain. Action speaks louder than war. Look around there's no time left to stall. (You've got to) stand up while you can don't miss the call. Hold on here we go. Where we stop nobody knows. Breath and count to five. Live while you're still alive. Right before your eyes. Your best laid plan up and dies. Cleverly disguised. The bounty materialized. Now we're moving fast. We're picking up on speed. We got the energy. Creating fast. As we tunnel deep. & no time to think. Here we just react. To the things. We need. Hold on to your world. Look around there's no time left to stall. (You've got to) stand up while you can don't miss the call. To live just in your mind. Is some kind of crime. Stuck in your station. In isolation. Never too late for beginning. To set your captive free. Tonight the moment has arrived. To live while we're still alive. (Wake up and) look around there's no time left to stall. (You've got to) stand up while you can don't miss the call. (It's time to) end the debate don't hesitate this time. (C'mon on and) take a stance don't miss your chance. To stand up right now!
158,311,Rock,When things are outta whack. And they might collapse. And at the end of the day. You still can't relax. And physically you ache. Like a cavity feelin' the bind. On your mind and the rest. Of your body. Listen to your heartbeat. Flow and imagine. Become Jackson Pollack. Air brush Chinese dragons. On a sky blue convertion. Van or an electra. Buick of the mind full of. Fuminous matter. And slowly all the pressure. Recedes and you stop to decay. Naturally think clearly. Ultimately though your grace. Will give way to traffic jams. Submachine guns in hand. City red-necks who think. Like the Omega man. Feelin' the extremes. Of the times we're livin'. Stockpile spaghetti-o's. And cheerios plannin'. To survive that fall-out shit.

I'm not dreamin' this is the real dealin'. There's nothin' like this trance. I'm caught in a daze. Cuz I'm finally out of my body. The blue lights are ablaze. Yeah I'm really amazed. And feelin' so light that's right. Lift off and I'm into the sky. As if a hologram were created. To shift my conciousness. Changed again and I'm flung. In the riff. I wanna be free I wanna do right. I move through the portal. To be purified. It's not ambuguous }. It be continuous }. It's all about us }. It's for real my man } (3x). The continuous life there is no end }. Movin' through life }. Movin' through death }.

161,311,Rock,Watching the ice melt between us. Just faster than grass grows. ItÃ­s not the best that weÃ­ve seen us. But nothing else I'd have chose. Reminds me of a time. When anything could have come. Anything could have happened. What a fantastic feeling. Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didn't miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didnÃ­t miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. When you fight to resist. Emotion with a fist. An irresistible force will always. Prevail. The fortress goes crumbling down. Around you where you stand. What was once strong mortar. Is now a pile of sand. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that IÃ­m careful now. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now. From reckless to recluse. And sometimes back again. Left wondering what's the use. Of a life of mischief spent. Makes cool the desert sun. The piece of mind that you gave me. Absolve me for things I've done. Only that can save me. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didnÃ­t miss. IÃ­ve dodged so many bullets that IÃ­m careful now.

A tone poem alone is love medicine then the demon. Spring revolution in my spirit here it is and I will kill with it. Traveling head spinnin' from the medicine. Illusions fadin' out an comin' on again. unwind your mind then find entire minutes abstract. the tract of sight day breaking in it. doles out my share of the world ocean and sun. Rising with whirling motion. I fought kicked and screamed my way to getting born now I feel. Warm and I say come on the night won't save anyone. won't you roam. We've grown so we can write again our soul select its own way for. The travellin'. we're here we're breathing and we wanna keep our.

Do i turn you on or maybe i turn you off. Could you just decide. Well i've been alone. And you've been a fool. Baby don't you know that's the golden rule. Well i've been alone. And you've been a fool. Baby don't you know that's the way i like it. Let me take you away on the wings of my superfly. Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the sky. Let me take you away on the wings of my superfly. Maybe we'll celebrate all the room in the skyheaven knows we'll go boom boom boom.
173,Abril,Rock,Muggy. Quando eu vou te pedir perdão?. Por não ter te encontrado. Quando estava tão. Sozinha ao meu lado. Na mesma direção. O que é viver em vão?. Por não ter conquistado. Tudo que tinha nas mãos. Eu sempre acreditei. Mais em mim do que em você. Se for melhor no fim. Desculpa se eu não soube te entender. É fácil de dizer estando longe de você. Eu já sei que me falta amor. Desculpa se eu não sei porquê. Eu sempre acreditei. Mais em mim do que em você. Se for melhor no fim. Desculpa se eu não soube te entender. É fácil de dizer estando longe de você. Eu já sei que me falta amor. Desculpa se eu não sei porquê. Eu já sei que me falta amor. Desculpa se eu não soube te entender. Eu já sei que me falta amor.

174,Abril,Rock,Como vai você vivendo por aí?. Por aqui vou eu no mesmo lugar. De todos seus planos eu não desisti. E os meus eu procuro encontrar. Cansei de escrever. Quero te falar. Pra te conhecer preciso me achar. Pra dizer adeus eu só preciso cantar essa música. Faz tanto tempo que eu nem sei. Aonde procurar. Faz tanto tempo que eu nem sei. Aonde você está. Como vai você vivendo por aí?. Por aqui vou eu no mesmo lugar. De todos seus planos eu não desisti. E os meus eu procuro encontrar. Cansei de escrever. Eu quero te falar. Pra te conhecer preciso me achar. Pra dizer adeus eu só preciso cantar essa música. Faz tanto tempo que eu nem sei. Aonde procurar. Faz tanto tempo que eu nem sei. Aonde você está
175,Abril,Rock,Queria só te falar. O que era certo no momento. E a lembrança que ficou. Deixou passar o nosso tempo. Queria só me desculpar. Por não mostrar meu sentimento. Espero não te ver partir. Pra evitar meu sofrimento. Me deixa aqui. Me deixe com os anjos. Que vão me carregar. Pra longe de tudo que eu lembrar. Me deixa sorrir. Me deixe com quem pode me levar. Pra longe de tudo que eu construí pra te esperar. . Os anjos estão vindo apagar o que eu sinto por você. Os anjos estão vindo arrancar tudo o que me faz sofrer. Por não mostrar um sentimento. Me deixa aqui. Me deixe com os anjos. Que vão me carregar. Pra longe de tudo que eu lembrar. Me deixa sorrir. Me deixe com quem pode me levar. Pra longe de tudo que eu construí pra te esperar
176,Abril,Rock,Amanhã. Diga. Fale tudo que souber. Corra. Faça da vida o que quiser. Sonhar. Voe alto sem perder a direção. Acordar. O medo não é solução. Tudo parou agora. Tudo mudou. Amanhã. Pode ser que o nada exista. E tudo seja ilusão. E o que importa agora. É esquecer então. Diga. Fale tudo que souber. Corra. Faça da vida o que quiser. E tudo parou agora. E tudo mudou. E amanhã. Pode ser que o nada exista. E tudo seja ilusão. E o que importa agora. É esquecer então. Amanhã. Será o fim de uma conquista. Ou de uma vida sem razão. E o que importa agora. É esquecer. Esquecer então
177,Abril,Rock,Não sei. O que eu vou te dizer. Sozinho é difícil crescer. Quem eu. Quem agora eu vou chamar. Espero que você entenda. Que eu não tenho aonde chegar. E como eu vou esquecer. Se você deixou de se importar. Com tudo que me faz viver. Com tudo que me faz acreditar. E como você se perdeu. Se é tão fácil de imaginar. Tudo aquilo que me faz crescer. Tudo aquilo que me faz sonhar. Eu cansei. Eu cansei de me arrepender. Ao menos eu tento enxergar. E hoje. Hoje como vai você. Tão longe de me ver lutar. E eu não tenho como chegar. E como eu vou esquecer. Se você deixou de se importar. Com tudo que me faz viver. Com tudo que me faz acreditar. E como você se perdeu. Se é tão fácil de imaginar. Tudo aquilo que me faz crescer. Tudo aquilo que me faz sonhar. E como eu vou lembrar você. Se você deixou de se importar. Com tudo que me faz viver. Com tudo que me faz acreditar. E como você se perdeu. Se é tão fácil de imaginar. Tudo aquilo que me faz crescer. Tudo aquilo que me faz sonhar
178,Abril,Rock,Foi quando o dia chegou. Antes do amanhecer. Quando o coração parou. Antes mesmo de eu perceber. Que estava perdido ao te encontrar. Que estava sozinho no mesmo lugar. Eu me despeço como quem não vai voltar. Você deixou de acreditar. Você chegou a duvidar de mim. Você perdeu o seu lugar. Que por muito tempo eu guardei aqui. E agora eu digo adeus. Pela manhã o sol se foi. E o dia escureceu. Um sentimento foi traído quando tudo se perdeu. E estava perdendo todo meu ar. E estava perdido no mesmo lugar. Eu me despeço como quem não vai voltar. Você deixou de acreditar. Você chegou a duvidar de mim. Você perdeu o seu lugar. Que por muito tempo eu guardei aqui. E agora eu digo adeus. Estranho é o deserto dentro de ti. E os muros que me impedem de chegar. A hora marcada de um triste fim. E o medo que eu tenho de errar. Você deixou de acreditar. Você chegou a duvidar de mim. Você perdeu o seu lugar. Que por muito tempo eu guardei aqui. E agora eu digo adeus
179,Abril,Rock,Quanto tempo passou. Só eu sei. Eu fico aqui perdido entre as lembranças. Que você deixou. O que te faz sonhar. Se eu me enganei. Se tudo aquilo que eu tinha. Você me tirou. Melhor assim. Já que eu não tenho. Mais pra onde ir. E pra você. Desejo sorte. E que alguém te faça ver. Que tudo pode ser tão diferente. Que você consiga mudar. E ver que o que queria. Não vale a pena. Não ter pra quem chamar. Não ter pra quem sorrir. Volte para o seu lugar. Mas se você quiser voltar. Eu estarei aqui por você. Mas se você quiser voltar. Eu estarei aqui por você. Para te esperar
180,Abril,Rock,Tenha cuidado. Veja aonde vai pisar. Olhe para sua frente. Saiba caminhar. O dia ainda não nasceu. Eu vejo tudo a minha volta. Eu vejo aqui o teu olhar. Eu vejo tudo diferente. Aonde você possa estar. A noite ainda não morreu. Me diz o que te faz feliz (2x). Se algum dia encontrar você. E eu não chamar teu nome. É porque eu não sei viver sem você. Eu vejo tudo a minha volta. Eu vejo aqui o teu olhar. Eu vejo tudo diferente. Aonde você possa estar. Me diz o que te faz feliz. Me diz o que te faz feliz. Aonde você quer chegar?. Aonde eu queria estar?. Se tudo que eu tenho te faz lembrar. Bons dias. Se algum dia encontrar você. E eu não chamar teu nome. É porque eu não sei viver sem você. Se algum dia encontrar você. E eu não chamar teu nome. É porque eu não aprendi a viver

Tudo aquilo que me faz crescer. Tudo aquilo que me faz sonhar
182,Abril,Rock,Não existe cura pra dores de alma. Remédio não há que faça adormecer o tempo. Há nuvens escuras que pairam acima do brilho do olhar. Mágoas não saem no removedor. Como é que se faz pra colar?. Será preciso engessar ossos do ofício do amor?. Como é que se faz pra colher a flor da pele sem dor?. Coração na mão. Os pés sobre uma corda bamba. Amadores são. A flecha sem alvo que dança
183,Abril,Rock,Amanhã. Diga. Fale tudo que souber. Corra. Faça da vida o que quiser. Sonhar. Voe alto sem perder a direção. Acordar. O medo não é solução. Tudo parou agora. Tudo mudou. Amanhã.

190,Abril,Rock,A tua diversão. É escrever pra dizer que acabou de chegar. Que passou por aqui e não quis me chamar. Eu bebi saudade a semana inteira. Pra domingo você me dizer. Que não sabe o que quer e não quer mais saber. Quando eu te peço um pouco é porque. Eu quero tudo que pode me dar. Quando eu te peço pra esquecer é porque. Eu quero te fazer lembrar... de tudo que passou. Quando eu te digo que eu não penso é porque. Eu não paro de pensar. Quando eu tento me esconder é porque. Eu só quero te mostrar... o que eu ainda sou. Deixei um monte de bilhetes na tua casa. O acaso me deixou tão só. Talvez eu ache algo mais forte Que faça eu me sentir melhor. Depois do que eu já andei. Depois do que eu tenho que andar. Quem sabe outro dia eu te Encontre em outro lugar. Quando eu te peço um pouco é porque. Eu quero tudo que pode me dar. Quando eu te peço pra esquecer é porque. Eu quero te fazer lembrar... de tudo que passou. Quando eu te digo que eu não penso é porque. Eu não paro de pensar. Quando eu tento me esconder é porque. Eu só quero te mostrar... o que eu ainda sou
191,Abuse,Rock,"""Tentar fazer. tudo que eu queria. tentar dizer. tudo que eu sentia. mostre-me sua opinião. tente não guardar rancor. exponha sua dor. você não é ou finge não querer. alguém que tenta. se esquivar ou se esconder. as vezes em que tentei. fugir para não voltar. o medo me impidiu até casar. """"a perfeiçao existe para ser desejada e não alcançada"""". superar a barreira. do proprio ego."""
192,Abuse,Rock,Eu só quero sobreviver. ajudar os outros a entender. que a vida não é só isso. basta saber viver. eu não quero acordar. acostumar com a miséria da vida. mais isso você tem que entender. dinheiro não é coisa nenhuma. e para sonhar não basta pensar. eu não quero crescer. para entender o que você me faz. eu não quero crescer. pra envolver na merda que o mundo traz.
193,Abuse,Rock,Por onde passo deixo meus pedaços. Acostumado a tropeços. Me levanto mais uma vez. Isso nunca irá parar eu sei. Mas pedaços eu digo. Aquele que vou passar pra frente. De obstáculos que pude pular. Como ao certo não sei. Mas a vida me mostrou o caminho. Vivi pra poder te dizer tudo isso. Tente entender o que for preciso. Pra você será diferente. Mas siga o seu estilo. Só o que posso dizer é que. Deixe acontecer e tenha força suficiente para reagir. Será fácil mais não será a última vez. Cada vez mais forte e amortecido. Mas posso sentir que vem mais um. Que pode não ser fácil. E servirá como apoio da próxima vez. Vivi pra poder te dizer tudo isso. Tente entender o que for preciso. Pra você será diferente. Mas siga o seu estilo. Este é o seu desafio.
194,Abuse,Rock,Tenho tudo mais não sei. quero o que não tenho. tenho só vontade de ter. talvez o caminho certo seja. refletir e pensar ao contrario. porque o homem complica. aquilo que é tão simples de entender. mas é preciso ver para crer. receber para depois agradecer. magoar para se negar. e ser amado para depois amar. e agora estou aqui. fingindo que tudo está bem. que a vida deve ser assim. um dia enfim se descobriu. quem é que fala por mim. nos uniremos novamete. para talvez sair juntos por ai.
195,Abuse,Rock,O homem destrói o meio ambiente. Foge do controle sem se preocupar. Indo além do que possa imaginar. Se esquecendo e se tornando ausente. Colocando todos no mesmo lugar. Radiação e desmatamento. Não percebe o mal que está nos corroendo. Os dias passam e o penssamento não muda. Estamos indo em passos lentos. E você o que tem feito. Para impedir que tudo isso ?. Quando percebermos. Poderá ser. Tarde de mais para pensar em voltar no tempo. Para revertemos o presente em que estamos vivendo.
196,Abuse,Rock,ABUSE - TV SHIT. por que eu tenho que aceitar. tudas as coisas que colocam no ar?. minha vida não precisa de vocês. nos deparamos com a miséria. por trás de nossas portas. formadores de opinião. manipulam quem quiser. ela quer te mudar. ela quer você. estão tentando te enganar essa é a TV. estão tentando te enganar não deixe isso acontecer. determinam um estilo de viver. o que devemos usar e escutar. a ignorância vem como consegüência. somente busca audiência
197,Acid Tree,Rock,Among sheets and broken glass. Stale drinks and old ash. I lie awake trapped in frozen dreams. Longing for the day that I will find peace. The old portrait stares at me. Cheerful eyes bring emptiness. Round the decay it stands pristine. A time when everything was green. I was strong and whole and bright. Then silently came the night. I can't breathe. You reach your hands to me. A glimmer of hope. A mocking smile. You keep dragging me down. There comes a time. You lived for so long you feel safe. But dreams shatter. By a simple twist of fate. There you stand. A ghost refusing to fade away. Green turned into gray. I'll follow you to the grave. Can we be saved from days long gone?. Can we be saved from innocence lost?. I can't breathe. You reach your hands to me. A glimmer of hope. A mocking smile. You keep dragging me down
198,Adam Lambert,Pop,Soaked to the bone. Sink like a stone. Walk home alone. It's not the first time. It's not the worst crime. Your soul will be ok. And you've had enough. Searching for love. And you miss the touch. Of someone new. Burned by your dreams. It's never how it seems. Cold crushed esteem. Take shelter. And hide forever. Your soul will be ok. And you've had enough. Searching for love. And you miss the touch. Of someone new. And you've had enough. Searching for love. And you miss the touch. Of someone new. Soaked to the bone. Sink like a stone. I will take you home. It's not the first time. It's not the worst crime. Our souls will be ok
199,Adam Lambert,Pop,The stars collide. They fall to earth alive. As my hunger hides. Desires that are burning. Ready to land. I shall overcome. And when you're numb. A deeper breath comes out. Wo oh oh. I'll make you beg for mercy. I'll make you beg for mercy. Yeah eh eh. Come to settle the score. The strenght inside. The lightning and the fun. I'll take in check. Won't hide it. In lightning you too under. The hard the post. Is racing towards a light. Is every beat I found. Go trickling down the vile. I'll make you beg for mercy. We rule the sun. We rule the sun. Yeah eh eh. I'll make you beg for mercy. Come to settle the score. Wo oh oh. My adrenaline is pumping. Yeah eh eh. I got it next to nothing. Wo oh oh. Come to settle the score. I'll make you beg for mercy. Wo oh oh. I'll make you beg for mercy. Yeah eh eh. Come to settle the score. Wo oh oh. I'll make you beg for mercy. We rule the sun. We rule the sun. I'll make you beg for mercy. We rule the sun. We rule the sun
200,Adam Lambert,Pop,And after all the said and done. You're gonna be the only one. Do you believe in love after love?. I can feel something inside me saying. I really don't feel you're strong enough
201,Adam Lambert,Pop,Tower of Babel has fallen down again. Information disarray. I dunno who I should believe in. Everybody's an authority. Fragments don't count. They always end up fallin' thru the cracks. Don't think out loud. 'Cuz once it's out your mouth. Can't take it back. Can't say all the little things. I wanna tell U right now. I know you won't understand. But I gotta tell you somehow. And on and on and on I go. Connect the neck to what's below. I know. Now your body language is. Broken. Broken english. Lost inside communication breakdown. Better just read my lips. Comin' in clearer when we get down. Iceberg just the tip. Iy words get lost. Can you read the look that's on. My face. Wires get crossed. In communion with the human race. Can't say all the little things. I wanna tell U right now. I know you won't understand. But I gotta tell you somehow. And on and on and on I go. Connect the neck to what's below. I know. Now your body language is. Broken. Broken english. Can't say all the little things. I wanna tell U right now. I know you won't understand. But I gotta tell you somehow. And on and on and on I go. Connect the neck to what's below. I know. Now your body language is. Broken. Broken english
202,Adam Lambert,Pop,You are my lava. My lava flow. Burn like no other. Right thru the core. Just like the constellations we shine. No wreck or ruin our Planets Align. The tide and the moon we are. You pull like the sea. In waves I can feel ya. You're My ecstasy. The lamb and the lion. We lay down in peace.. Like air to the fire. I need you to breathe. By the rules I play. By the rules I play. By the rules I play. Let nature have its way. Predator and prey. That's the way we're made. So By the rules. By the rules. By the rules. After the thunder. Must come the rain. After our beautiful karma. Must come the pain. Just like the constellations we fade. As blades of sunlight eh send night away. The tide and the moon we are. You pull like the sea. In waves I can feel ya. You're My ecstasy. The lamb and the lion. We lay down in peace.. Like air to the fire. I need you to breathe. By the rules I play. By the rules I play. By the rules I play. Let nature have its way. Predator and prey. That's the way we're made. So By the rules. By the rules. By the rules
203,Adam Lambert,Pop,Guess it was not meant to be. It’s not as bad as it seems. It only burns when I breathe. You saw the way that I fell. But I’m better off by myself. That’s the tale I like to tell. But it’s not that easy for me to say goodbye. Everything in me wants you back in my life. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. It feels like the dawn of the dead. Like bombs going off in my head. Never a moment of rest. Nothing kills more than to know. That this is the end of the road. And I know I gotta let go. But it’s not that easy for me to say goodbye. Everything in me wants you back in my life. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Wish I could just find a way. To have all your memories erased. Cos constantly they’re haunting me. But it’s not that easy for me to say goodbye. Everything in me wants you back in my life. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. I can’t let you go. I can’t let you go
204,Adam Lambert,Pop,Hello world. Hope you're listening. Forgive me if I'm young. For speaking out of turn. There's someone I've been missed. I think that they could be. The better half of me. They're in their own place trying to make it right. But I'm tired of justifying. So I say you'll... Come home. Come home. Cause I've been waiting for you. For so long. For so long. And right now there's a war between the vanities. But all I see is you and me. The fight for you is all I've ever known. So come home. Oooh. I get lost in the beauty. Of everything I see. The world ain't as half as bad. As they paint it all to be. If all the sons. If all the daughters. Stopped to take it in. Well hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin. It might start now... Well maybe I'm just dreaming out loud. So hear this now. Come home. Come home. Cause I've been waiting for you. For so long. For so long. And right now there's a war between the vanities. But all I see is you and me. The fight for you is all I've ever known. Ever known. So come home. Everything I can't be. Is everything you should be. And that's why I need you here. Everything I can't be. Is everything you should be. And that's why I need you here. So hear this now. Come home. Come home. Cause I've been waiting for you. For so long. For so long. And right now there's a war between the vanities. But all I see is you and me. The fight for you is all I've ever known. Ever known. So come home. Come home
205,Adam Lambert,Pop,Died last night in my dreams. Walking the streets. Of some old ghost town. I tried to believe. In God and James Dean. But Hollywood sold out. Saw all of the saints. Lock up the gates. I could not enter. Walked into the flames. Called out your name. But there's no answer. And now I know my heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. Died last night in my dreams. All the machines. Had been disconnected. Time was thrown at the wind. And all of my friends. Had been disaffected. Now I'm searching for trust. In a city of rust. A city of vampires. Tonight Elvis is dead. And everyone's spread. And love is a satire. And now I know my heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. There's no one left in the world. I'm gunslingin'. Don't give a fuck if I go. Down down down. I got a voice in my head that keeps singin'. Oh. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town
206,Adam Lambert,Pop,Variety's the spice it’s clear. But nothing's for free. Can you hear it all the. Branches fall from the tree. Smothered by the sound of. Silence ran out of breath. Listen for the audience and. Power to death. They can’t hear you any more. Because they're all deaf. They can’t hear you any more. Because they're all DEAD. MP3s killed the record companies (x4).

207,Adam Lambert,Pop,Tie up my hands tonight. Don't let me go. Binding my eyes from sight. Binding my soul. Take hold of me. Take hold of me. Sacrifice (x4). Throw bones on the fire. Throw down control. Laying down the law. Lay me down slow. Take hold of me. Take hold of me. I give myself untho the. Sacrifice (x4). I'm your one and only sacrifice. I'm your one and only sacrifice. Binding my soul. Don't let me go. I'm your one and only sacrifice. Don't let me go. Sacrifice (x5)
208,Adam Lambert,Pop,Soaked to the bone. Sink like a stone. Walk home alone. It's not the first time. It's not the worst crime. Your soul will be ok. And you've had enough. Searching for love.

209,Adam Lambert,Pop,You turn. Just to spite me. You run. Where i can not see. You walk. All over me. But you won't. You won't. You know. What you'll never be. You show. All your pleasantries. You'd love. To lash out at me. But you won't. No you won't. Everytime i hear the sound. Of footsteps walking up to a door. I turn around and i don't see your face. Inside my mind anymore.. The circle is now complete. The loser admits defeat. They're taking us by surprise. No one will realize. You want. What you can't posses. You love. For me to confess. You said. That you were the best. But you're not. No you're not. And tell me i'll do it. It's nothing at all. Slipping through my fingers. Losing grip and i. Can see that you fall. The circle is now complete. The loser admits defeat. They read in between the lines. No-one will realize. The circle is now complete (x2). The circle (x2). Turn to spin the wheel. And turn me out to. Where there's nothing at all.

215,Adam Lambert,Rock,Tower of Babel has fallen down again. Information disarray. I dunno who I should believe in. Everybody's an authority. Fragments don't count. They always end up fallin' thru the cracks. Don't think out loud. 'Cuz once it's out your mouth. Can't take it back. Can't say all the little things. I wanna tell U right now. I know you won't understand. But I gotta tell you somehow. And on and on and on I go. Connect the neck to what's below. I know. Now your body language is. Broken. Broken english. Lost inside communication breakdown. Better just read my lips. Comin' in clearer when we get down. Iceberg just the tip. Iy words get lost. Can you read the look that's on. My face. Wires get crossed. In communion with the human race. Can't say all the little things. I wanna tell U right now. I know you won't understand. But I gotta tell you somehow. And on and on and on I go. Connect the neck to what's below. I know. Now your body language is. Broken. Broken english. Can't say all the little things. I wanna tell U right now. I know you won't understand. But I gotta tell you somehow. And on and on and on I go. Connect the neck to what's below. I know. Now your body language is. Broken. Broken english
216,Adam Lambert,Rock,You are my lava. My lava flow. Burn like no other. Right thru the core. Just like the constellations we shine. No wreck or ruin our Planets Align. The tide and the moon we are. You pull like the sea. In waves I can feel ya. You're My ecstasy. The lamb and the lion. We lay down in peace.. Like air to the fire. I need you to breathe. By the rules I play. By the rules I play. By the rules I play. Let nature have its way. Predator and prey. That's the way we're made. So By the rules. By the rules. By the rules. After the thunder. Must come the rain. After our beautiful karma. Must come the pain. Just like the constellations we fade. As blades of sunlight eh send night away. The tide and the moon we are. You pull like the sea. In waves I can feel ya. You're My ecstasy. The lamb and the lion. We lay down in peace.. Like air to the fire. I need you to breathe. By the rules I play. By the rules I play. By the rules I play.

217,Adam Lambert,Rock,Guess it was not meant to be. It’s not as bad as it seems. It only burns when I breathe. You saw the way that I fell. But I’m better off by myself. That’s the tale I like to tell. But it’s not that easy for me to say goodbye. Everything in me wants you back in my life. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. It feels like the dawn of the dead. Like bombs going off in my head. Never a moment of rest. Nothing kills more than to know. That this is the end of the road. And I know I gotta let go. But it’s not that easy for me to say goodbye. Everything in me wants you back in my life. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Wish I could just find a way. To have all your memories erased. Cos constantly they’re haunting me. But it’s not that easy for me to say goodbye. Everything in me wants you back in my life. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. Can’t let you go. I can’t let you go. I can’t let you go
218,Adam Lambert,Rock,Hello world. Hope you're listening. Forgive me if I'm young. For speaking out of turn. There's someone I've been missed. I think that they could be. The better half of me. They're in their own place trying to make it right. But I'm tired of justifying. So I say you'll... Come home. Come home. Cause I've been waiting for you. For so long. For so long. And right now there's a war between the vanities. But all I see is you and me. The fight for you is all I've ever known. So come home. Oooh. I get lost in the beauty. Of everything I see. The world ain't as half as bad. As they paint it all to be. If all the sons. If all the daughters. Stopped to take it in. Well hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin. It might start now... Well maybe I'm just dreaming out loud. So hear this now. Come home. Come home. Cause I've been waiting for you. For so long. For so long. And right now there's a war between the vanities. But all I see is you and me. The fight for you is all I've ever known. Ever known. So come home. Everything I can't be. Is everything you should be.

219,Adam Lambert,Rock,Died last night in my dreams. Walking the streets. Of some old ghost town. I tried to believe. In God and James Dean. But Hollywood sold out. Saw all of the saints. Lock up the gates. I could not enter. Walked into the flames. Called out your name. But there's no answer. And now I know my heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. Died last night in my dreams. All the machines. Had been disconnected. Time was thrown at the wind. And all of my friends. Had been disaffected. Now I'm searching for trust. In a city of rust. A city of vampires. Tonight Elvis is dead. And everyone's spread. And love is a satire. And now I know my heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. There's no one left in the world. I'm gunslingin'. Don't give a fuck if I go. Down down down. I got a voice in my head that keeps singin'. Oh. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town

226,Adrian Suirady,Rock,Uma bala perdida se torna noticia. Em toda uma mídia fodida e falida. Crime hediondo se torna a rotina. Na vida daqueles que clamam a justiça. Vampiros que vagam pelas cidades. Carregam a sua Ankh da Paz. Em meio à rotina desenfreada. De tolos babacas que não enxergam nada. De terno e gravata levantam suas taças. Espalham mentiras que se tornam verdades. Somos os monstros que vagam de dia. Nós somos os monstros que vagam de noite. Nós somos aqueles que clamam a justiça!. Vampiros que vagam pelas cidades. Carregam a sua Ankh da Paz. Em meio a rotina desenfreada. De tolos babacas que não enxergam nada
227,Adrian Suirady,Rock,Morte e violência em cada esquina. Esse não foi o mundo que nos prometeram. É um mundo macabro e cheio de dores. O que aconteceu com o bom senso humano?. O que houve com as nossas crianças?. São todas vazias e estão tão perdidas. Aonde está agora a sua rebeldia?. As pessoas já deixaram de se importar. Nós estamos fodidos em meio a essa merda. Eu não quero ser só mais um na multidão. Correndo em meio a toda essa confusão. Nós somos aqueles que não se conformam. Nós somos aqueles que ainda se importam. Mas nem sempre foi assim
228,Adrian Suirady,Rock,"""O artista que era anticapitalista. Apresentou a sua obra num banco. O japonês liberal a quatro meses. Associou em vídeo um boicote a censura. E disse que boicote nunca foi censura. A militante que protesta. Contra mulheres De biquíni. Em propagandas de cerveja. Virou a maior defensora. Da liberdade de expressão. O mal humorado que reclama. Das piadas de um show de stand up. Defendeu mais leveza da humanidade. O jornalista que regula. O que se deve vestir. Nas malditas fantasias de carnaval. Acha que o mundo. Deve ser mais desencanado. O tolerante religioso que protesta. Contra as manifestações. Cômicas ao candomblé. Disse que não viu nada demais. O simpatizante das capas do Charlie Hebdo. Viu agora a profanação religiosa. O defensor dos animais. Fingiu que não sabe de nada. O militante Lgbt que se enfurece. Toda vez que é associado. A aberrações como a zoofilia. Declarou que a exposição é progressista. O crítico que se manifesta. Contra o """"Blackface"""" em peças de teatro. Decretou que não há Limites. Para a expressão artística. E a comunidade artística. Que faz boicote para a não exposição. De obras de arte de direita. Em Festivais de cinema. Disse que boicotes para a não exposição. De obras de arte é violação. Aos direitos humanos. O debate político brasileiro. Não é mesmo para amadores"""

262,Aerosmith,Rock,Blues hearted lady. Sleepy was she. Love for the devil. Brought her to me. Seeds of a thousand. Drawn to her sin. Seasons of whither. Holdin me in. Oh woe is me. I feel so badly for you. Oh woe is me. I feel so sadly for you in time. Bound to lose your mind. Live on borrowed time. Take the wind right out of your sails. Fireflies dance in the heat of. Hound dogs bay at the moon. My ship leaves in the midnight. Can't say I'll be back too soon. They awaken. Far far away. Heat of my candle. Show me the way. Seeds of a thousand. Drawn to her sin. Seasons of whither. Holdin me in. Oh woe is me. I feel so badly for you. Oh woe is me. I feel so sadly for you in time. Bound to lose your mind. Live on borrowed time. Take the wind right out of your sails
263,Aerosmith,Rock,I was a city boy. Caught up in a city way. A nitty gritty boy. Was out all night. And always gettin' blown away. There ain't no breeze that cool the heat of love. She was a city girl. With no responsibility. A pretty little city girl. All fired up and what's. That got to do to me. 'Cause there ain't no breeze that cool the heat of love. It's as clear as a. Sunrise in Sedona. Just what it is. That's blowin' in the wind. It's the fire in her eyes. It's the tear when she cries. It's the heat when I fall on my knees. That I'm thinkin' of. There ain't no breeze that cool the heat of love. It's as clear as a. Sunrise in Sedona. Just what it is. That's blowin' in the wind. It's the fire in her eyes. It's the tear when she cries. It's the heat when I fall on my knees. That I'm thinkin' of. There ain't no breeze that cool the heat of love

Pois não há tristeza no mundo maior. Que a força de quem quer sorrir. Tudo pode ser melhor. Felicidade está dentro de você. E nada deve ser maior. Do que o amor e a vontade de viver.

291,Aliados,Rock,Tempo Que Eu Perdi ------------------------------------------. . Estava muito sozinho. E o desespero tomou conta da minha fé. O tempo que muda. Uma vida confusa. Esperando o seu fim pra ver como é. Ontem a noite. Nem sai de Casa. Procurando respostas. Sem saber o que se passa. O medo soou como um alarme. Eu acordei. O tempo que eu perdi. Aquilo que eu não fiz. Encontrei nos segundos em que olhei ao meu redor. E percebo que não há nada melhor. LETRA – Fildzz – Dudu Golzi.

292,Alice Cooper,Rock,Man's got his woman to take his seed. He's got the power - oh. She's got the need. She spends her life through pleasing up her man. She feeds him dinner or anything she can. She cries alone at night too often. He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Man makes your hair gray. He's your life's mistake. All you're really lookin' for is an even break. He lies right at you. You know you hate this game. He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain. She cries alone at night too often. He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Black eyes all of the time. Don't spend a dime. Clean up this grime. And you there down on your knees begging me please come. Watch me bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed.
293,Alice Cooper,Rock,Collecting pieces of my family. In an old pillow case. This one has a skull. But it don't have a face. These look like the arms of father so strong. And the ring on this finger. Means my Grandmother's gone. Here's some legs in a pile. Where my sister once played. Here's some mud made of blood. And these teeth are decayed. The ear of my brother. The hand of a friend. And I just can't. Put them back together again. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. There are stains on the floor. Where the kitchen once stood. There are ribs in the fireplace. Mixed with the wood. There are forces in the air. Ghosts in the wind. Some bullets in the back. And some scars on the skin. There were demons with guns. Who marched through this place. Killing everything that breathed. They're an inhuman race. There are holes in the walls. Bloody hair on the bricks. And the smell of this hell. Is making me sick. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. Now maybe someday. The suns gonna shine. Flowers will bloom. And all will be fine. But nothing will grow. On this burnt cursed ground. Cuz the breath of the death. Is the only sound.

303,Alice Cooper,Rock,Sixty million tons of meat. Spoiling in the stinking heat. Train full loads of moldy bread. Millions will still go unfed. Acres full of dying wheat. Burning brightly at our feet. A billion tons of roasted fish. Some with nothing on their dish. We can't see we're going blind. We're just dying on the vine. We're all sinking from the weight. Open wide and salivate. Do you like the taste?. Stuff it in your face. Its not nice to waste. We're not happy 'til we're choking. So we eat some more. Throw up on the floor. Go back to the store. We're so hungry. So pathetic. Lots of melting cheddar cheese. Spreading instant meat disease. Rotting veggies on the ground. Where hungry little kids are found. Worms in fruit an ugly sight. They're begging for a single bite. Our garbage dumps are mountains high. While other people sadly die. We can't see we're going blind. We're just dying on the vine. We're all sinking from the weight. Open wide and salivate. Do you like the taste?. Stuff it in your face. Its not nice to waste. We're not happy 'til we're choking. So we eat some more. Throw up on the floor. Go back to the store.

I'm crying in my beer Escape. Just get me out of here. Don't get me wrong. Don't get me right. I'm not like you are. When I get home from work at night. I'm blacker and bluer. So I escape. I get out when I can. Escape. Anytime I can. Escape. I'm crying in my beer Escape. Just get me out of here. Where am I running to?. There's no place to go. Just put on my makeup and get me to the show. Yeah. Escape. My doctor said just come around. You'll be taken care of. And while he ran my problems down. I stole his mascara. That's how I escape. I get out when I can. Escape. Anytime I can. Escape. I'm crying in my beer Escape. Just get me out of here. Escape.
305,Alice Cooper,Rock,I got lost on the road somewhere. Was it Texas or was it Canada. Drinking whiskey in the morning light. I work the stage all night long. At first we laughed about it. My long-haired drunken friends. Proposed a toast to Jimmy's ghost. I never dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end. I'm stuck here on the inside looking out. I'm just another case. Where's my makeup where's my face on the inside. All got your kicks from what you saw up there. Eight bucks even buys a folding chair. I was downing seagrams on another flight. And I worked that stage all night long. You were screaming for the villain up there. And I was much obliged. The old road sure screwed me good this time. It's hard to see where the vicious circle ends. I'm stuck here on the inside looking out. That's no big disgrace. Where's my makeup where's my face on the inside.
306,Alice Cooper,Rock,A tree has grown on the spot. Where her body did rest. Blood seeped into the soil. From the knife in her chest. The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail. I wonder how the bugs remember Gail. What a lovely young girl. Everybody would say. You can still hear her laugh. In the shadows on a cold winter's day. A dog dug up a bone and wagged it's tail. I wonder how the dog remembers Gail. The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail. I wonder how the bugs remember Gail.

308,Alice Cooper,Rock,For criminal acts and violence on the stage. For being a brat. Refusing to act your age. For all of the decent citizens you've enraged. You can go to Hell. For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly. For making us doubt our parents authority. For choosing to be a living obscenity. You can go to Hell. You're something that never should have happened. You even make your Grandma sick. You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane. You'd gift-wrap a leper. And mail him to your Aunt Jane. You'd even force-feed a diabetic a candy cane. You can go to Hell. You're something that never should have happened. You even make your Grandma sick. For criminal acts and violence on the stage. For being a brat. Refusing to act your age. For all of the decent citizens you've enraged. You can go to Hell.
309,Alice Cooper,Rock,Gather round right now. And hear me whisper. The words of the prison. The words of laughter. The lords and the ladies. Were fixing their hair-dos. Cursing their lovers. Cursing the Bible. Hallow-ed by my name. Yelling at fathers. Screaming at mothers. Hallow-ed by my name. Come all you sinners. Come now in your glory. And my ears will listen. To your dirty stories. You're fighting to go up. You're sure on your way down. Cursing their lovers. Cursing the Bible. Hallow-ed by my name. Yelling at fathers. Screaming at mothers. Hallow-ed by my name. Sluts and the hookers. Have taken your money. The queens are out dancing. But now it's not funny. 'Cause there goes one walkin'. Away with your sonny. Cursing their lovers. Cursing the Bible. Hallow-ed by my name. Yelling at fathers. Screaming at mothers. Hallow-ed by my name.
310,Alice Cooper,Rock,I've got the answers. To all of your questions. If you've got the money. To pay me in gold. I will be living. In old Monte Carlo. And you will be reading. The secrets of soul. Daggers and contacts. And bright shiny limos. I've got a watch. That turns into a lifeboat. Glimmering nightgowns. And poisonous cobras. Silencer under the heel of my shoe. The elegance of China. They sent her to lie here on her back. But as she deeply moves me. She'd rather shoot me in my tracks. And while a Middle Asian lady. She really came as no surprise. But I still did destroy her. And I will smash. Halo of flies. I crossed the ocean. Where no one could see. And I put a time-bomb. In your submarine. Goodbye to old friends. The secret's in hand. With phony papers. And counterfeit plans. You never will understand
311,Alice Cooper,Rock,Life. Coast to coast. White hot as a ghost. When you live. In a countdown. Time. Is free as a jailbird. At least that's what I heard. When you live. In a hideout. Love. Comes cheap at a swapmeet. It all comes so dirt cheap. When you live. In a bedroom. Love. Cuts deep as a razor. But that ain't amazin'. When you live. In a cancer. Ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah. Ah. Mind. Gets scrambled like eggs. Get bruised and erased. When you live. In a brainstorm. Noise. Seems logically right. Ringing ears in the night. When you live. In an airport. Ah-ah-ah.

314,Alice Cooper,Rock,Touched by thoughts. as cold as ice. Like some bathroom floor. No love can be worth this price. Still I ask for more. Endless days and restless nights. And forgotten scenes. Hopelessly I tried to find. Escape from this deam. Baby I miss you. When are you coming home. No matter where you are. I hate being alone. Love is sweet. And bitter too. The taste can leave cold. You know I hate it. But I cannot refuse to capture control. How it seems. There's no way out. I guess I never knew. Emptiness has left no doubt. Now I want you. Baby I miss you. When are you coming home. No matter where you are. I hate being alone. Baby I miss you. When are you coming home. No matter where you are. I hate being alone. Baby I miss you. When are you coming home. You've been gone for so long. Baby I miss you. When are you coming home. Tell me you're coming back.
315,Alice Cooper,Rock,Sometimes I'm James Bond. Sometimes I'm Billy The Kid. Sometimes I feel like Sherlock Holmes. Sometimes I feel like Jack The Ripper. 'Cause I got an image out of control.

316,Alice Cooper,Rock,"""It's not like we did something wrong. We just burned down the church. While the choir within sang religious songs. And it's not like we thought we was right. We just played with the wheels of a passenger train. That cracked on the tracks one night. It's not like we ain't on the ball. We just talk to our shrinks. Huh they talk to their shrinks. No wonder we're up the wall. We're not stupid or dumb. We're the lunatic fringe who rusted the hinge. On Uncle Sam's daughters and sons. Good old boys and girls. Congregating waiting in another world. With roller coaster brains. Imagine playing with trains. Good old boys and girls. Congregating waiting in some other world. We're all crazy we're all crazy we're all crazy. Lizzy Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks. And don't think we're trying to be bad. All the innocent crime seemed alright at the time. Not necessarily mad not necessarily mad. We watch every day for the bus. And the driver would say. """"That's where lunatics stay"""". I wonder if he's talking about us. It's not like we're vicious or gone. We just dug up the graves where your relatives lay. In old forest lawn. And it's not like we don't know the score. We're the fragile elite they dragged off the street. I guess they just couldn't take us no more. Good old boys and girls. Congregating waiting in another world. With roller coaster brains. Imagine digging up graves. Good old boys and girls. Congregating waiting in some other world. We're all crazy we're all crazy we're all crazy we're all crazy. We're all crazy we're all crazy we're all crazy we're all crazy. We're all crazy."""

La-aa-ace and whiskey. La-aa-ace and whiskey. La-aa-ace and whiskey. La-aa-ace and whiskey.
321,Alice Cooper,Rock,I got my invitation to the annual levity ball. Seeing the location is within the mirrored room. Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find. I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind. I sat down on the stairway seven hours at a time. Writing all of this poetry that I knewq would never rhyme. The memory I knew I must have had when I came in. Was of some varied places where I've never ever been. And then in came a cake all decorated in my name. With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name. The clock was passing out from time to time I saw it all. The beginning of the ending of my first levity ball
322,Alice Cooper,Rock,Living is only one part of being. Believing is to know just what you're feeling. You and some positive think you know you had. I'm sure you knowing you're growing and it's you. Thinking is you're own world of living. Dreaming is the one way to feeling. Your mind and your eye can see everything that you. The only real person you need to know is you.
323,Alice Cooper,Rock,We still got a long way to go. We still got a long way to go. We all got a long way to go. What's keeping us apart isn't selfishness. What's holding us together isn't love. Listen to the man who's been. Touched all his life. Yes he's the one they call the fool. Where is the saviour of the sidewalk life. And the road that takes us to the crusades. I've seen the shadows. As they're moving in my sleep. Leading the blind poet to his grave. We still got a long way to go. We still got a long way to go. Yes we all got a long way to go. Please don't waste your energy on me my friend. Cause we still got a long way to go. We'll meet again some day. But right now just go away. Cause I still got a long way to go. The silence is speaking. So why am I weeping. I guess I love it. I love it to death. We still got a long way to go. Yes we still got a long way to go. Yes we all got a long way to go.
324,Alice Cooper,Rock,Billie I wonder why are we insane. Will we ever get better. Will we stay the same. Billie I'm worried. Millie don't worry. No one knows our pain. Being in love is crazy not alone that way. I know you're worried today. God made love crazy so we wouldn't feel alone. He was thinking of us he was thinking of us. God made love crazy so we wouldn't feel so alone. Billie my mind seems to wander. To events of a night long ago. Driving alone with our guilt well concealed. In the trunk of your '68 Olds. Millie our world's an asylum. And our minds like you say ain't that straight. But you know and I know our passion's. Not deformed it's true I'd say. We'll love our lifetime. God made love crazy so we wouldn't feel alone. He was thinking of us he was thinking of us. God made love crazy so we wouldn't feel so alone. Billie I dream of our children. They're frightening and gruesome and sad. And I don't want them growing inside me. They're no price for the love that we have. Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane. Oh Millie oh Billie. Oh Billie it's fresh in my memory. The night that it had to be done. You with your pick axe and scissors. And you with your shovel and gun. And I liked your late husband Donald. But such torture his memory brings. All sliced up and sealed tight in baggies. Guess love makes you do funny things. Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane. Oh Millie oh Billie.
325,Alice Cooper,Rock,Ahhhh. We've been so caught up in the subject first again. Playing and laughing and slaving and begging our friend. Who lies and to try to cut off our heads like we were. Painting our picture to show everyone in the world. Show them. Killing is natural. The legs and faces can break. We're not superiors. Hiding behind the grey paint. Who lies and to try to cut off our heads like we were. Painting our picture to show everyone in the world. Ahhhh. Ahhhh. Ahhhh. Ahhhhhhhhhh. Woo woo woo woo woo woo.
326,Alice Cooper,Rock,No time for tears. Stars don't have time to cry. No time for tears. He's just another guy. Who used your heart. But don' forget who you are. You're playing the part. The greatest movie star. So soul aches. You think it's. The end of it all. But tears always dry. And all of us lie. That's all. Yeah tears always dry. And all of us lie. That's all. Your soul aches. You cry out. You're weeping. You're while. But tears always dry. And all of us lie. Sometimes. Yeah tears always dry. And all of us lie. Sometimes. But tears always dry. And all of us lie. Sometimes?. Yeah tears always dry. All of us lie. Sometimes?. Only sometimes.
327,Alice Cooper,Rock,I'm a shepherd for the pentecost. I got my scriptures and my wires crossed. I got no kids and I got no home. They want us holy men to live alone. Since I've been here for a little stay. I see Rozetta day by day. She turns my head makes me cough. I want to tear my collar off. I just can't sleep at night. Rozetta dressed in white. She's got the Devil's light. Shining in her eyes. Screamed my sermon damning sin and vice. When underneath I was a regular guy. My pulpit melted like a block of ice. When a bolt of lightning hit me from the sky. From my stretcher when they wheeled me in. I stared directly in the eyes of sin. Nurse Rozetta standing over me. And I was helpless as a man of God could be. Nurse Rozetta I won't let her. Catch me peering down her sweater. Fantasizing silk suspenders on her thighs. Nurse Rozetta make me better. Secretly my eyes undress her. Let me feel your tongue depressor. I'm suddenly twice my size. My pants are all wet inside. She's so creative with a bar of soap. And so inventive with a stethoscope. To check my pulse she gotta hold my hand. I blow the fuse on the encephalogram. Satan sent her from the bowels of hell. I should have recognized old Jezbel. I surrendered to the urges felt. She popped the buckle on my bible belt. I just can't sleep at night. Rozetta dressed in white. She's got the Devil's light. Shining in her eyes. I'd lick her nylon seams. Like a hungry cat with cream. Oh what a vivid scene. And I can't hold back no more.
328,Alice Cooper,Rock,Man's got his woman to take his seed. He's got the power - oh. She's got the need. She spends her life through pleasing up her man. She feeds him dinner or anything she can. She cries alone at night too often. He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Man makes your hair gray. He's your life's mistake. All you're really lookin' for is an even break. He lies right at you. You know you hate this game. He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain. She cries alone at night too often. He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Black eyes all of the time. Don't spend a dime. Clean up this grime. And you there down on your knees begging me please come. Watch me bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed.
329,Alice Cooper,Rock,Collecting pieces of my family. In an old pillow case. This one has a skull. But it don't have a face. These look like the arms of father so strong. And the ring on this finger. Means my Grandmother's gone. Here's some legs in a pile. Where my sister once played. Here's some mud made of blood. And these teeth are decayed. The ear of my brother. The hand of a friend. And I just can't. Put them back together again. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. There are stains on the floor. Where the kitchen once stood. There are ribs in the fireplace. Mixed with the wood. There are forces in the air. Ghosts in the wind. Some bullets in the back. And some scars on the skin. There were demons with guns. Who marched through this place. Killing everything that breathed. They're an inhuman race. There are holes in the walls. Bloody hair on the bricks. And the smell of this hell. Is making me sick. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. Now maybe someday. The suns gonna shine. Flowers will bloom. And all will be fine. But nothing will grow. On this burnt cursed ground. Cuz the breath of the death. Is the only sound.
330,Alice Cooper,Rock,I couldn't tell. If the bells were getting louder. The songs they ring I finally recognize. I only know. Hell is getting hotter. Devil getting smarter all the time. And it would be nice. To walk upon the water. To talk again to angels. On my side. Time is getting closer. I read it on a poster. Fanatical exposers. On corners prophesy. It would be nice. To walk upon the water. To talk again to angels. At my side. I just come back to show you. All my words are golden. So have no gods before me. I'm the light.
331,Alice Cooper,Rock,When I look back at my time at the track. And I played and I played and I played and I was. Shooting the craps at the back of Fat Jack's. Come on fade me Jake. I'm a Las Vegas dreamer they took to the cleaners. A bath what a bath what a bath I'd take. A fish on a hook I was rattled and shook 'cause I lost my stake. I took that serious. All of my life was a laugh and a joke. And a drink and a smoke. And then I passed out on the floor. Again and again and again and again and again. I'm a gambling fool with a roll and a cue. Wanna play wanna play wanna play with me. Put my ass on the line rubbed my nose in the grime. And they picked me clean. The chance and the game drove Old Silkly insane. What a pain what a strain on my brain it was. A fish on a hook I was rattled and shook 'cause I lost my stake. I took that serious. All of my life was a laugh and a joke. A drink and a smoke. And then I passed out on the floor. Again and again and again and again and again. Serious it was serious oh so serious. Serious it was serious oh so serious. All of my life was a laugh and a joke. A drink and a smoke. And then I passed out on the floor. Or a friend. Again and again and again and again and again. All of my life was a laugh and a joke. A drink and a smoke. And then I passed out on the floor. Or a friend. Again and again and again and again and again and again. And again and again and again and again and again. And again and again.
332,Alice Cooper,Rock,Instrumental
333,Alice Cooper,Rock,I wake up in the basement. I'm so hungry. I'm dry. I must be here sleepwalking. Mustn't I?. Getting up from my easy chair looking for my wife. Following a trail of crimson. Spots that lead into the night. Suddenly I realize. I see it all through real eyes. These crimson spots are dripping from my hand. And ooh it makes me feel like a man.
334,Alice Cooper,Rock,The California air. Your nightgown on the stairs. I remember every night. Scenes from home in the Quiet Room. How long have I been gone. Did winter kill the lawn. And all those polaroids you sent. Are on the wall in the Quiet Room. They've got this place. Where they've been keeping me. Where I can't hurt myself. I can't get my wrists to bleed. Just don't know why. Suicide appeals to me. The Quiet Room. Is sterilized and white. It's like a tomb. With just a moth stained naked night. Plastic forks and spoon. No laces in my shoes. They all know what I tried to do. Outside the Quiet Room. This quiet place. It ain't so new to me. It's haunted atmosphere. Has heard so many scream. My home from home. My twilight zone. My strangest dream. My confidant. I have confessed my life. The Quiet Room. Knows more about me than my wife. They've got this place. Where they've been keeping me. Where I can't hurt myself. I just can't I just can't get these damn wrists to bleed. A mattress on the floor. No handles on the door. I really need nothing here. I'm alone.
335,Alice Cooper,Rock,Hurting me. Seems to be. Your passion. Misery. Is certainly. Your style. I'm like a kid in a candy store. I'm on my knees 'til I lick the floor. Can't stand to look at your face. But I'm burning for more. Sharpest pain. The ugly scar. The deepest cut. Is what you are. The burning sting. Is what you bring. And you remain. The sharpest pain. You're the star. In your own sad story. I'm just a toy. You can drag around. You're about as sick as you can be. A twisted abnormality. I don't want to be your first fatality. Sharpest pain. The ugly scar. The deepest cut. Is what you are. The burning sting. Is what you bring. And you remain. The sharpest pain. Though your never ever funny. I just gotta laugh out loud. Cuz you keep me in stitches. Until the last thread of decency runs out. Sharpest pain. The ugly scar. The deepest cut. Is what you are. The burning sting. Is what you bring. And you remain. The sharpest pain. Sharpest pain. The ugly scar. The deepest cut. Is what you are. The burning sting. Is what you bring. And you remain. The sharpest pain
336,Alice Cooper,Rock,instrumental
337,Alice Cooper,Rock,Welcome to my nightmare. I think you're gonna like it. I think you're gonna feel like you belong. A nocturnal vacation. Unnecessary sedation. You want to feel at home 'cause you belong. Welcome to my nightmare. Welcome to my breakdown. I hope I didn't scare you. That's just the way we are when we come down. We sweat and laugh and scream here. 'cuz life is just a dream here. You know inside you feel right at home here. Welcome to my breakdown. Whoa. You're welcome to my nightmare. Yeah. Welcome to my nightmare. I think you're gonna like it. I think you're gonna feel that you belong. We sweat and laugh and scream here. 'cuz life is just a dream here. You know inside you feel right at home here. Welcome to my nightmare. Welcome to my breakdown. Yeah
338,Alice Cooper,Rock,"""She looked so sleek and sassy. Rolling down Rodeo Drive. She got her daddy's black Corniche. And her tennis pro by her side. And she wants her mother's lover. To exercise her skill. And if she don't score him fast. She knows that her brother will. Oh I wish I were born in Beverly Hills. I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills. I want to live it up get my kicks and thrills. Be a gigolo lover and send her the bills. She says that she's an actress. Just never got a part. Now she's a teenage mess. With a burned out Gucci heart. She cracked one day at Cartier. When things came to a head. They put her trinkets away. And wrapped her up instead. Oh I wish I were born in Beverly Hills. I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills. I want to live it up get my kicks and thrills. Be a gigolo lover and send her the bills. She bit like a dog and she screamed like hell. """"You ain't taking me to no padded cell. You better take all your hands off my high priced tail"""". Oh I wish I were born in Beverly Hills. I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills. I want to live it up get my kicks and thrills. Be a gigolo lover and send her the bills."""
339,Alice Cooper,Rock,We like to throw our bodies around. We like to feel each other. We're all slaves when we hear that sound. says dance. says dance. says ya gotta dance. says dance. and there ain't no two ways about it. We're all compelled to rise and thrust. when we all move together. We're all hypnotized by savage lust. says dance. says dance. says ya gotta dance. says dance. I'm so hot it makes me shiver. makes me wet. makes me slide. It's some spirit I'm possessed by. I can't stop. We just got to dance. dance. dance. We gotta blow when he says blow. And we gotta shake and shimmy. We got the strings tied to our soul. Says dance. says dance. says we gotta dance. (and I don't mean tomorrow). says dance.
340,Alter Bridge,Rock,Looking back I clearly see. What it is that's killing me. Through the eyes of one I know. I see a vision once let go. I had it all. Constantly it burdens me. Hard to trust and can't believe. Lost the faith and lost the love. When the day is done. Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. On and on we stand alone. Until our day is gone. When they open their eyes. And realize we are one. I love the way I feel today. How I know the sun will fade. Darker days seem to be. What will always live in me. But still I run. It's hard to walk this path alone. Hard to know which way to go. Will I ever save this day. Will it ever change. Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. Still today we carry on. I know our day will come. When they open their eyes. And realize we are one. Oooooooh..... (solo de guitarra). Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. (its hard to walk this path alone. hard to know which way to go). Will they open their eyes. and realize we are one. (lost the faith and lost the love. when the day is done). Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one
341,Alter Bridge,Rock,The willow it weeps today. A breeze from the distance is calling your name. Unfurl your black wings and wait. Across the horizon it's coming to sweep you away. It's coming to sweep you away. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. The fragile cannot endure. The wrecked and the jaded a place so impure. The static of this cruel world. Cause some birds to fly long before they've seen their day. Long before they've seen their day. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. Beyond the suffering you've known. I hope you find your way. May you never be broken again. Ascend may you find no resistance. Know that you made such a difference. All you leave behind will live to the end. The cycle of suffering goes on. But the memories of you stay strong. Someday I too will fly and find you again. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. Beyond the suffering you've known. I hope you find your way. May you never be broken again. May you never be broken again
342,Alter Bridge,Rock,I've been defeated and brought down. Dropped to my knees when hope ran out. The time has come to change my ways. On this day. I see clearly. Everything has come to life. A bitter place and a broken dream. And we'll leave it all. Leave it all behind. I'll never long for what might have been. Regret won't waste my life again. I won't look back I'll fight to remain. On this day. I see clearly. Everything has come to life. A bitter place and a broken dream. And we'll leave it all behind. On this day. It's so real to me. Everything has come to life. Another chance to chase a dream. Another chance to feel. Chance to feel alive. Fear will kill me. All I could be. Lift these sorrows. Let me breathe. Could you set me free. Could you set me free. On this day. I see clearly. Everything has come to life. A bitter place and a broken dream. And we'll leave it all behind. On this day. It's so real to me. Everything has come to life. Another chance to chase a dream. Another chance to feel. Chance to feel alive
343,Alter Bridge,Rock,When all is lost to you inside. when all the darkness takes the light. the ritual warning has begun. and now you tear away from everyone. disconnected so alone. severed ties from all you know. isolation. brings you to the end. until you love again. isolation. if you could only see. what will come to be?. yeah. justify you waste away. you dare to dream but still you're too afraid. and now you're broken and deceived. lost to live this cruel reality. you?re disconnected so alone. severed ties from all you know. isolation. brings you to the end. until you love again. isolation. if you could only see. what will come to be?. yeah. maybe you'll stand. maybe you'll give and break to find another way. and makes things better. maybe you'll find. a life you can live and learn to love along the way. and makes things better. and make things better. isolation. brings you to the end. until you love again. isolation. if you could only see. what will come to be?. yeah. isolation. brings you to the end. until you love again. isolation. if you could only see. what will come to be?. yeah. you're disconnected so alone. what will come to be?. you're disconnected so alone
344,Alter Bridge,Rock,I couldn't sleep I had to listen. To a conscience knowing so well. That nothing comes from indifference. I look inside of myself. Will I find some kind of conviction?. Will I bid the hero farewell?. Will I be defined by things that could have been?. I guess time will only tell. I guess time will only tell. [Chorus:]. So don't let it be. Before tomorrow comes. Before you turn away. Take the hand in need. Before tomorrow comes. You could change everything. I curse my worth and every comfort. That blinded me for way too long. Damn it all I'll make a difference from now on. Cause I'm wide awake to it all. Cause I'm wide awake to it all. [Chorus]. Does anyone care it ain't right what we're doing?. Does anyone care it ain't right where we're going?. Does anyone dare justify how we're living?. Does anyone here care at all?. [Chorus]. We could be so much more than we are. We could be so much more than we are. We could be so much more than we are. Oh this much I know
345,Alter Bridge,Rock,They say you are right. I hope that I'm wrong. I know that you tried. But still it is gone. Just don't you lose hope. I swear I never dream that we're alone. Now don't you let go. I swear I still believe though I don't know. Remember the years. I still walked tall. I only fear. Now I only crawl. How could I be wrong?. I hope there comes a day your fear is gone. How could we be lost?. Lost just seize to be not carry on. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. You can love someone. Go never to ask why. Or to fear again. Go find your peace tonight. Go set out towards the sun. Let the new begin. Go soon your day will come.. Day will come. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Truth alone. Truth alone. Truth alone
346,Alter Bridge,Rock,And as your will is bent and broken. And every vision has been cast into the wind. As your courage crashes down before your eyes. Don't lay down and die. 'Cause I see in you. More than you'll ever know. And I ask you why. You question the strength inside. And you need to know. How it feels to be alive. When every wound has been reopened. And in this world of give and take you must have faith. And the distance to your dreams stretches beyond reach. Don't lay down and die. 'Cause I see in you. More than you'll ever know. And I ask you why. You question the strength inside. And you need to know. How it feels to be alive. How it feels. How it feels to be alive. How it feels. How it feels to be alive. How it feels. How it feels to be alive. 'Cause I see in you. More than you'll ever know. And I ask you why. You question the strength inside. And you need to know. How it feels to be alive. How it feels to be alive
347,Alter Bridge,Rock,Endless Days. We search for what we hold inside. So hard to find. Luck turns. will the fallen ever reach within. and rise again. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. that were always here. I will find the meaning this time. I will fight the end. Till the end is here. Wasted time. With words that seem to break our will. They bind us still. Without a care. they tarnish what we hold so dear. what was once so clear. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. That were always here. I will find the meaning this time. I will fight the end. Till the end is here. The end is here. The end is here. The end is here. The end is here. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. That were always here. I will find the meaning this time. I will fight the end. Till the end is here
348,Alter Bridge,Rock,To the ones in which we sing. We are honored you let us in. I remember the thoughts of many things. Of the glory that you bring. I was never the right one. To dare to dream. It's funny what this life has done to me now. You were always the only. To help me see that was a road I must find. A road that was mine. But I'm down to my last. I'm standing here alone. Looking back on it all. I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong and. I'm blind to it all. And to the ones in which we sing. Ones who tried to do us in. I remember your name and I know your face. I can't forgive and can't erase. I was never the right one. To bear the weight. Of something fueled by words I learned to hate. You were always the only. To help me see that to love is to shine. In your world I'm blind. But I'm down to my last. I'm standing here alone. Looking back on it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong and. I'm blind to it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm scared of it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm blind to it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm blind to it all. by Jordana Bonasina
349,Alter Bridge,Rock,Stuck in the middle. I burrow inside. Back to the cradle. Away from the burdens of all my crimes. Before it's fatal. My past has found me. The truth's come out. All is remembered. With no place to fall but straight down. I must surrender. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real. There's a face. I put on all my life. The face of an angel. But I look in the mirror. Only to find. The face of a stranger. And with all I've taken. I hunger for more. 'Cause I'm selfish. And all I'm left with is a crown of thorns. And I'm helpless. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real. I'll trade these lies for something right. I'll kill what hurts with something pure. I will be redeemed so I can breathe again. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real

352,Alter Bridge,Rock,It's too late the time has come. I've kept this inside me for way too long. Silence will leave me cold. Lost on a highway that never takes me home. [Chorus:]. I want to step aside. I want to give it up. Before I lose it all. It's tearing me inside. The way you break me down. Oh there will come a time. When I will come undone. And you will let me fall. I'll leave it all behind. Before you break me down. The weight of a thousand lies. Promises broken haunt me all the time. You say that you're sure to change. But that black heart reveals that. You'll always stay the same. [Chorus]. I realize. Forgiveness. Is calling. It's calling. I've denied. The reason. I'm falling. I'm falling. So let go. [Chorus]
353,Alter Bridge,Rock,You were hungry for life. Then you took mine. Left me so hollow. And I was eager to play. To give you all of me. For what I will never know. Well I'll rest my eyes. And I'll let the earth breathe. And I'll bide my time. I'll let the earth breathe. You wiped the smile from our face. Our saving grace. Our lasting passion. And with a knife in our soul. We realize. We will not feel it. Well I'll rest my eyes. And I'll let the earth breathe. And I'll bide my time. I'll let the earth breathe. Well it's all I am. And it makes me feel at home. And I must be mad. And I must not care at all. Well I want my life. And I feel it taking on. 'cause it left me here. And it left me all alone. Well I'll rest my eyes. I'll let the earth breathe. And I'll bide my time. I'll let the earth breathe. Well I'll rest my eyes. I'll let the earth breathe. And I'll bide my time. I'll let the earth breathe
354,Alter Bridge,Rock,I twist and turn. In the darkest space. Can't find my worth. As I numb the pain. Glass to the sky. With a blacktooth grin. This whiskey smile. Takes me down again. I'm cold and I'm so afraid. That I'm too weak and I can't change. I've been buried alive and. I don't want to be here anymore. Reached out a thousand times for. A hand to pull me from below. I've been buried alive in a world. Of constant sorrow. Reach down tonight and set me free.... Save tomorrow. Another shot. Slip into the haze. Another night. Soaked in my disgrace. Toast to the lie. I'll raise my glass and run. A wasted life. What have I become?. I've been buried alive and. I don't want to be here anymore. Save tomorrow. Save tomorrow. Let me breathe again. Show me where I begin. To find the will to change. Before I lose everything. I've been buried alive and. I don't want to be here anymore. Reach down tonight and set me free. And I will follow
355,Alter Bridge,Rock,Drank so much last night. I think that I drowned. But now my cup is empty. No one has seen my will around. Now my heart is aching. Sometimes I fall asleep for days. But my bed is empty. I know I'm too set in my ways. Tell 'em all I'm okay. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on. Flew so high last night. I think that I fell. To the ground so heavy. Woke up to find this living hell. It used to be so easy. Hard to tell my nights. Now from my days. The curtains hide my feelings. Don't feel I have any right to pray. And will they find me someday. Someday. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on. And whatever takes us away. Will be the same to drive us on. And whatever takes us away. Will be the same to drive us on. Remember to find a new way. A way to see it all. It's finally slipping away. Soon it will be gone. Remember to find a new day. Remember to carry on. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on
356,Alter Bridge,Rock,When all the lights have faded. The encore’s come and gone. And I can’t take this no more. Well I can’t keep pretending. I just can’t play the part. I need the solace of her shore. I need the solace of her shore. Coeur d’Alene is calling out. And it won’t be long. Coeur d’Alene I’m coming now. Where I still belong. I look into the mirror. I don’t know who I am. The lives are torn apart. I still long for the simple. I’m just a common man. And with this aching heart. Coeur d’Alene is calling out. And it won’t be long. Coeur d’Alene I’m coming now. Where I still belong. Safe at last in your arms. I’m safe at last in your arms. Coeur d’Alene is calling out. Where the waters calm. Coeur d’Alene I’m coming now. And it won’t be long
357,Alter Bridge,Rock,As I peel away. All the years of pain. I discovered what's been all along. You were so right. I was so wrong. Every shooting star. They all fall so hard. They all fade like a played out song. Now is the time. Before all is lost. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. [Chorus]. So I'm coming home. Lost on a road I don't belong. I'll rest my song. I'm so alone. Far from the streets I call my own. I'm coming home. Rushing back to me. As the city sleeps. So afraid of what I will find. Memories they haunt. From deep inside. Every broken man. Comes to understand. that he'll never find paradise. When all that he wants. Was there all the time. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. [Chorus]. So I'm coming home. Lost on a road I don't belong. I'll rest my song. I'm so alone. Far from the streets I call my own. So I'm coming home. Back to a world left long ago. And now I know. I'm coming home. I'll find my way back. I'm letting go. I'm coming home. We come to find. What we take for granted. Keeps us alive in the end. So don't let time. Leave you empty handed. Reach out tonight and make amends. [Chorus]. So I'm coming home. Back to the place where I belong. I'll rest my song. I'm so alone. Far from the streets I call my own. So I'm coming home. Back to a world left long ago. Now I know. I'm coming home. I'll find my way back. I'm coming home. I'm coming home
358,Alter Bridge,Rock,Crying out. Now you can't escape you are. buried in doubt. And it pulls you down. Now you're in too deep you may never get out. Such an awful fate. Tear it down. It's almost too late is the end coming now. As you scream out loud. You sever the peace til. your truth has been found. Is there nothing left to follow?. Is there nothing left to steal?. Crying out for something more. than I've been shown. Knowing none of this is real. Don't close your eyes. Something beautiful is still alive. Don't close your eyes. Never turn away and let it die. I cannot seem to find the answers. Every truth has slipped away. All that riddles me will. never cease to be. Still I search this world in vain. Don't close your eyes. Something beautiful is still alive. Don't close your eyes. Never turn away and let it die. Cry out to save tomorrow. It's not too late. Your heavy heart will follow. You to the grave. This is not the end!. This is not the end!. Don't close your eyes. Something beautiful is still alive. Don't close your eyes. Never turn away and let it die. We can't hesitate. Hope is not too late. For the time has come. what have we become?. Nothing left to do but deny the truth
359,Alter Bridge,Rock,To the ones in which we sing. We are honored you let us in. I remember the thoughts of many things. Of the glory that you bring. I was never the right one. To dare to dream. It's funny what this life has done to me now. You were always the only. To help me see that was a road I must find. A road that was mine. But I'm down to my last. I'm standing here alone. Looking back on it all. I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong and. I'm blind to it all. And to the ones in which we sing. Ones who tried to do us in. I remember your name and I know your face. I can't forgive and can't erase. I was never the right one. To bear the weight. Of something fueled by words I learned to hate. You were always the only. To help me see that to love is to shine. In your world I'm blind. But I'm down to my last. I'm standing here alone. Looking back on it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong and. I'm blind to it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm scared of it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm blind to it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm blind to it all. by Jordana Bonasina
360,Alter Bridge,Rock,Stuck in the middle. I burrow inside. Back to the cradle. Away from the burdens of all my crimes. Before it's fatal. My past has found me. The truth's come out. All is remembered. With no place to fall but straight down. I must surrender. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real. There's a face. I put on all my life. The face of an angel. But I look in the mirror. Only to find. The face of a stranger. And with all I've taken. I hunger for more. 'Cause I'm selfish. And all I'm left with is a crown of thorns. And I'm helpless. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real. I'll trade these lies for something right. I'll kill what hurts with something pure. I will be redeemed so I can breathe again. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real

362,Alter Bridge,Rock,I've been defeated and brought down. Dropped to my knees when hope ran out. The time has come to change my ways. On this day. I see clearly. Everything has come to life. A bitter place and a broken dream. And we'll leave it all. Leave it all behind. I'll never long for what might have been. Regret won't waste my life again. I won't look back I'll fight to remain.

Before you die in the cold. And though the sky's caving in. The fear must not gain control. And do not worry my friend. Or make this call by your sole. And find a new way to live.

364,Alter Bridge,Rock,Underneath the desert sun. They bid my brother's blood to run. Many miles away. Hell has come today. Fire raining from the sky. See the face of fear asking one last time. Let me get home safe. Before it's too late. One by one. The brave will fall. Life is lost again. They gave it all. Deep within the castle walls. So many grieve as funeral songs. Echo endlessly. Ode to memories. This sacrifice of flesh and blood. For a promised land that may not be won. Let us not forget the hero laid to rest. One by one. The brave will fall. Life is lost again. They gave it all. And they gave it all. A price we can't ignore. Is there hope in what they're dying for?. For every hero born. For every family torn. We will honour you forever more. One by one. The brave will fall. Life is lost again. They gave it all. One by one. The brave will fall. Life is lost again. They gave it all
365,Alter Bridge,Rock,And as your will is bent and broken. And every vision has been cast into the wind. As your courage crashes down before your eyes. Don't lay down and die. 'Cause I see in you. More than you'll ever know. And I ask you why. You question the strength inside. And you need to know. How it feels to be alive. When every wound has been reopened. And in this world of give and take you must have faith. And the distance to your dreams stretches beyond reach. Don't lay down and die. 'Cause I see in you. More than you'll ever know. And I ask you why. You question the strength inside. And you need to know. How it feels to be alive. How it feels. How it feels to be alive. How it feels. How it feels to be alive. How it feels. How it feels to be alive. 'Cause I see in you. More than you'll ever know. And I ask you why. You question the strength inside. And you need to know. How it feels to be alive. How it feels to be alive
366,Alter Bridge,Rock,Looking back I clearly see. What it is that's killing me. Through the eyes of one I know. I see a vision once let go. I had it all. Constantly it burdens me. Hard to trust and can't believe. Lost the faith and lost the love. When the day is done. Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. On and on we stand alone. Until our day is gone. When they open their eyes. And realize we are one. I love the way I feel today. How I know the sun will fade. Darker days seem to be. What will always live in me. But still I run. It's hard to walk this path alone. Hard to know which way to go. Will I ever save this day. Will it ever change. Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. Still today we carry on. I know our day will come. When they open their eyes. And realize we are one. Oooooooh..... (solo de guitarra). Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. (its hard to walk this path alone. hard to know which way to go). Will they open their eyes. and realize we are one. (lost the faith and lost the love. when the day is done). Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one
367,Alter Bridge,Rock,Well they're selling another messiah here tonight. But we're all way to numb and divided to buy it. Singing. No no no. We are all too divided this time. No no no. Show me a leader that. Wont! compromise. Show me a leader so. Hope! never dies. We need a hero this time. No no no. Dissillusioned and tired of waiting. For the one.

(We need a hero this time) no. Or we will never survive no no. we need a hero this time no!. Or we will never survive
368,Alter Bridge,Rock,I cast a line when I saw you were drowning. Still you turn your back on me. Pulled you from the fire when you were burning. Still you never could believe. So carry on if you must go your way. Though it breaks my heart. Your free will still remains. I save you from your fall when you were slipping. Still you broke from me to run. So how can you justify the life you're living. You must carry on if you must go your way. Though it breaks my heart. Your free will still remains. You'll deny. You'll deny me once again. But I've seen it all. I know you've come to crawl. Back to me before the end. Carry on if you must go your way. Though it breaks my heart. Your free will still remains. So carry on if you must go your way. Though it breaks my heart. Your free will still remains. Still remains
369,Alter Bridge,Rock,I won’t waste away. I won’t let this take me down. I can’t survive. As long as I keep it around. I wish it would fade. But it will just sell me out. Over and over and over.

I run till I break. From the way it was killing me. Profuse to the day. I’ll suffer afraid to speak. I carry the shame. And beg for a remedy. How long must I live. With the damage of my disease. SOMEBODY SAVE ME…. SOMEBODY SAVE ME…. The Race I Run. I Keeps Me Focused On. The Man I Could Become. The Damage Done. I Want To Wash The Filth Away. Till There Is None. The Race I Run.

370,Alter Bridge,Rock,Endless Days. We search for what we hold inside. So hard to find. Luck turns. will the fallen ever reach within. and rise again. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. that were always here. I will find the meaning this time. I will fight the end. Till the end is here. Wasted time. With words that seem to break our will. They bind us still. Without a care. they tarnish what we hold so dear. what was once so clear. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. That were always here. I will find the meaning this time. I will fight the end. Till the end is here. The end is here. The end is here. The end is here. The end is here. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. That were always here.

371,Alter Bridge,Rock,Watch your words. Or your words might drown you. And cure my wounds. And the light will blind you. To truly see well. You must have faith. Oh the righteous they can't wait. A saving grace. That we all know. Let us pray. Let us hold on. I can't breathe. I prefer to find a ceiling. To this hate of mine. I can't win. I can fight no more. I'm drowning. And I'm sick inside. Push no more. And the day will find you. Speak no truth. And your ways will end you. It's alright. And you must move on. Though the damage has been done. Cherish the life. And the ones you hold. Can you change. Can you go on. I can't breathe. I prefer to find a ceiling. To this hate of mine. I can't win. I can fight no more. I'm drowning. And I'm sick inside. To truly see well. You must have faith. Oh the righteous. They can't wait. A saving grace. That we all know. Let us pray. Let us hold on. I can't breathe. I prefer to find a ceiling. To this hate of mine. I can't win. I can fight no more. I'm drowning. And I'm sick inside
372,Alter Bridge,Rock,And they cry. And they call. As the wayward walk alone. City lights. Urban sprawl. In a place no one should know. Shown no grace. Shown no love. These mean streets are meant for none. [Chorus:]. Take them back to the start. Let the purest of heart. Know their worth is still spoken. As they fight to exist. We neglect and resist. Let this circle be broken. Broken homes. Broken lives. They repeat themselves in time. It's passed on. Down the line. Till we heal the wounds inside. It's not too late. To make things right. Dress wounds with loves pure light. [Chorus:]. Take them back to the start. Let the purest of heart. Know their worth is still spoken. As they fight to exist. We neglect and resist.

Bring the wayward one back home tonight. Take them back to the start. Let the purest of heart. Know their worth is still spoken
373,Alter Bridge,Rock,Crack the heart with true intentions. Blood and scars and no redemption. We’ve been a slave to your disaster. Lost it all it doesn’t matter. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. Waste aways amount to nothing. But your opinions keep on coming. We’re dead inside to your rejection. Risk it all and did I mention. I’ll say it again. I’ll say it again. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. Never doubt it. Never question. What we were. And where we’ve been. Scream out loud. As our intentions. Find a word. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. I’ll say it again. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong
374,Alter Bridge,Rock,They say you are right. I hope that I'm wrong. I know that you tried. But still it is gone. Just don't you lose hope. I swear I never dream that we're alone. Now don't you let go. I swear I still believe though I don't know. Remember the years. I still walked tall. I only fear. Now I only crawl. How could I be wrong?. I hope there comes a day your fear is gone. How could we be lost?. Lost just seize to be not carry on. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. You can love someone. Go never to ask why. Or to fear again. Go find your peace tonight. Go set out towards the sun. Let the new begin. Go soon your day will come.. Day will come. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Truth alone. Truth alone. Truth alone

384,Amy Lee,Rock,Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit. There isn't any other stair quite like it. I'm not at the bottom. I'm not at the top. So this is the stair where I always stop. Halfway up the stairs. Isn't up and isn't down. It isn't in the nursery. It isn't in the town. And all sorts of funny thoughts. They run thorugh my head. It isn't really anywhere. It's somewhere else instead. Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit. There isn't any other stair quite like it. I'm not at the bottom. I'm not at the top.

388,Anberlin,Rock,Words like violence. Break the silence. Come crashing in. Into my little world. Painful to me. Pierce right through me. Cant you understand. Oh my little girl. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Vows are spoken. To be broken. Feelings are intense. Words are trivial. Pleasure remains. So does the pain. Words are meaningless. And forgettable. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Enjoy the silence
389,Anberlin,Rock,Are there no shadows where you are?. I can see everything as day. Problems that you try to hide away. Pushing me aside (You're pushing me aside). Could the winter calm come twice?. Because your heart seems so cold tonight. Thirst for substance somehow isn't right. It's killing me inside (It's killing you inside). Killing me inside. I don't wanna be where you are. I don't wanna be here even now. I don't wanna be by your side. If something isn't right. If something isn't right. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodbye. This is where love ends. Are you so naive to right and wrong. How could you watch innocence forgone. Does what we've done ever really belong?. It wasted me away (I feel so wasted away). God if you can hear me out alright. Please take these feelings for her inside. My chest hurts when I breathe tonight. It's wasting me away (You're wasting me away). You're wasting me away. I don't wanna be where you are. I don't wanna be here even now. I don't wanna be by your side. If something isn't right. If something isn't right. This is our last (This is our last). This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been. This our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our goodbye. This is where love ends. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodbye. This is where love ends

'cause i haven't heard from you in ages. i relive each memory. from time to time. read notes exchanged. with all those scented pages. it's comin back. it's all comin back to me now. tell me everything turned out alright. cause i'm where we said. that we'd meet tonight. does he treat you like you want?. does he ask to take your hand?. does he believe in dreams we talked about?. when with no music we danced. i thought you said that you'd come find me. i thought you said you'd be home by now. i heard you sang that you'd come back here. so i wrote to remind you somehow. dance by yourself and. think of me when you do. i'm not sure you understand. what this means to me. what you do to me. i'm willing to prove. that you're the one. i regret to slip away. now i know it was only you. that i've been searchin for. been missin all this time. i thought you said that you'd come find me. i thought you said you'd be home by now. i heard you sang that you'd come back here. so i wrote to remind you somehow. i thought you said that you'd come find me. i thought you said you'd be home by now. i heard you sang that you'd come back here. so i wrote to remind you somehow. let the past be past. let's start today. letters won't do. i need to see your face. tell me where to meet. i'll tell you why we should be. (i'll tell you why we should be). i thought you said that you'd come find me. i thought you said you'd be home by now. i heard you sang that you'd come back here. so i wrote to remind you somehow. i thought you said that you'd come find me. i thought you said you'd be home by now. i heard you sang that you'd come back here. so i wrote to remind you somehow
391,Anberlin,Rock,Are there no shadows where you are?. I can see everything as day. Problems that you try to hide away. Pushing me aside (You're pushing me aside). Could the winter calm come twice?. Because your heart seems so cold tonight. Thirst for substance somehow isn't right. It's killing me inside (It's killing you inside). Killing me inside. I don't wanna be where you are. I don't wanna be here even now. I don't wanna be by your side. If something isn't right. If something isn't right. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodbye. This is where love ends. Are you so naive to right and wrong. How could you watch innocence forgone. Does what we've done ever really belong?. It wasted me away (I feel so wasted away). God if you can hear me out alright. Please take these feelings for her inside. My chest hurts when I breathe tonight. It's wasting me away (You're wasting me away). You're wasting me away. I don't wanna be where you are. I don't wanna be here even now. I don't wanna be by your side. If something isn't right. If something isn't right. This is our last (This is our last). This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been. This our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our goodbye. This is where love ends. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodbye. This is where love ends
392,Anberlin,Rock,I'm not sure. If you can call this romance. You see we've changed since the start. Even together. We're distant lonely and apart. But we both look the other way. Pretend we still believe it. When they say. I guess that's why they call this love. Sadly unpredictable. And I guess that's why they call this love. Fate and fatal. My heart doesn't beat. As fast as it once did. I would sever these ties. But you're the perfect tourniquet. Tell me darling. Should we look the other way. When they say. And I guess that's why they call this love. Sadly unpredictable. And I guess that's why they call this love. Fate and fatal. Its getting hard to stay. But even harder to let go. And tell me now darling. Is this how we thought love was meant to go. [Spanish]. And I guess that's why they call this love. Sadly unpredictable. And I guess that's why they call this love. Fate and fatal
393,Anberlin,Rock,Growing tired of bedside resolve. (Politics lay out the pressure). Something's got to give now. Something's going to break down. I grow tired of writing songs. While people listen but never hear what's really going on now. Tell me what's so wrong now. Clap your hands all ye children. There's a clamor in your whispering. Clap your hands tonight. Hear what the silence screams. Clap your hands. Clap your hands now all ye children. Clap your hands all ye children. There's a clamor in your whispering tonight. For most of men believe hell is never knowing who they are now. (Tell me who you are now). Finally saved from the outside trapped in what you know. Are you safe from yourself? Can you escape all by yourself?. Clap your hands all ye children. There's a clamor in your whispering. Clam your hands tonight. Hear what the silence screams. Clap your hands. Clap your hands now all ye children. Clap your hands all ye children. There's a clamor in your whispering tonight. Clap your hands. Clap your hands now all ye children. Clap your hands. There's a clamor in your whispering tonight. It's not the lives that you save. But what the silence will scream. It's not the lives that you save. But what the silence will scream. It's not the lives that you save. But what the silence will scream. Clap your hands all ye children. There's a clamor in your whispering. Clap your hands tonight. Hear what the silence screams. Clap your hands. Clap your hands now all ye children. Clap your hands all ye children. There's a clamor in your whispering tonight. . ::.MahBellini.::

395,Anberlin,Rock,This is surrender. To a war-torn life I've lived.. Scars and stripes forever. In need of change I can't resist.. No need to hide anything anymore.. Can't return to who I was before.. I can finally breathe.. Suddenly alive.. I can finally move.. The world feels revived.. This long of a struggle. Finally opened up my eyes.. Revolution's not easy. With a Civil War on the inside.. No need to hide anything anymore.. Can't return to who I was before.. I can finally breathe.. Suddenly alive.. I can finally move.. 'Cause I realize.. I can finally breathe.. Suddenly alive.. I can finally move.. The world feels revived.. I can finally breathe.. Suddenly alive.. I can finally move.. 'Cause I realize.. I can finally breathe.. Suddenly alive.. I can finally move.. The world feels revived.. I can finally breathe.. Suddenly alive.. I can finally move.. The world feels revived.. [jr_linkin]
396,Anberlin,Rock,This life's electric. You can feel the pulse out on the street. The boys keep moving. Girls they always seem to follow the beat. This town it breathes in. A hunger deeper down it's underground. These Changes they change. Familiar faces at one time look strange. Call me crazy cause i still hold on. Call me foolish i'm believer. we were never meant to walk alone. i don't think i'm the last of the dreamers. City's electric tonight. Burning under bright lights. The city's so active alive. Can you feel it?. You know we're living out loud like we still need it. we still need it. City electric. The city's electric tonight. The search is still on. Voices calling out from wilderness. Some say to let go. Some things are out of your control. I tried but i can't stop. Tried but i can't stop til we progress. Til we progress. Call me crazy but there's still a change. Call me foolish an overachiever. We can be exactly who we want. I don't think i'm the last of the dreamers. City's electric tonight. Burning under bright lights. The city's so active alive. Can you feel it?. You know we're living out loud like we still need it. we still need it. City electric. The city's electric tonight. Live like you feel it. Live like you need it. Live like you feel this. Live like you love. Live like you love. The city's electric tonight
397,Anberlin,Rock,Words like violence. Break the silence. Come crashing in. Into my little world. Painful to me. Pierce right through me. Cant you understand. Oh my little girl. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Vows are spoken. To be broken. Feelings are intense. Words are trivial. Pleasure remains. So does the pain. Words are meaningless. And forgettable. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Enjoy the silence
398,Anberlin,Rock,I?ve seen this here. I?ve stood here before.. You know I have boy.. You know I?ve been right here.. I?ve felt the fire from this war.. You know I have so.. So let me see it again.. And you are my fading photograph.. And ripped memory.. And your burning memoirs rest here.. You know they wrestle with me.. You are the noise in here. I cannot sleep without.. Constant reminders everywhere in between. You are the way out of here.. The grace that I have found. Constant reminders everywhere in between. I?ve lived out all my crazy Vegas dreams.. I?ve seen it all boy.. I?ve seen it all right here.. And now regret the glamour that I have made.. Please forgive me.. Oh God forgive me.. And you are my fading photograph.. And ripped memory.. And your burning memoirs rest here.. You know they wrestle with me.. You are the noise in here. I cannot sleep without.. Constant reminders everywhere in between. You are the way out of here.. The grace that I have found. Constant reminders everywhere in between. I walked away from. And now I wish a poem. I?ve come to tell you. I?m coming home tonight. I?m on my way back home. And your arms tell me it?s been too long. I?m on my way back home. And your lips tell me it?s been too long. You are the noise in here. I cannot sleep without. Constant reminders everywhere in between.. You are the noise in here. I cannot sleep without. Constant reminders everywhere in between.. You are the way out of here. The grace that I have found. Constant reminders everywhere in between.
399,Anberlin,Rock,A hollow hallelujah. Hangs in the corner. With the rest of our dissolving years. You're the storm and the calm. The dove and the bomb. Ghost that relieves all my fears. Don't let this bedroom hold. As years and sheets unfold. We'll be able to sleep on the love. The weight of the world. Is on top of me. And I wouldn't have you anywhere else. The weight of the world. Is on top of me. And I'll hold you here all myself. Like a land-worthy sailor. I am a falter and failure. Trying to find my heading back home. You're the cure and the disease. The vice I still need. Casting the break in my bones. You're the life that's worth living. The hurt and forgiving. You're Jesus to the demons you've bored in my head. The weight of the world. Is on top of me. And I wouldn't have you anywhere else. The weight of the world. Is on top of me. And I want to keep you all for myself. The weight of the world. Is on top of me. And I wouldn't have you anywhere else. The weight of the world. Is on top of me. And I want to keep you all for myself. Weight of the world. The weight of the world. Is on top of me. And I want to keep you all for myself
400,Anberlin,Rock,Whenever I'm alone with you. You make me feel like I am home again. Whenever I'm alone with you. You make me feel like I am whole again. Whenever I'm alone with you. You make me feel like I am young again. Whenever I'm alone with you. You make me feel like I am fun again. However far away. I will always love you. However long I stay. I will always love you. Whatever words I say. I will always love you. I will always love you. Whenever I'm alone with you. You make me feel like I am free again. Whenever I'm alone with you. You make me feel like I am clean again. However far away. I will always love you. However long I stay. I will always love you. Whatever words I say. I will always love you. I will always love you.
401,Anberlin,Rock,Mother. Tell your children not to walk my way. Tell your children not to hear my words. What they mean. What they say. Mother. Mother. Can you keep them in the dark for life. Can you hide them from the waiting world. Mother. Father. Gonna take your daughter out tonight. Gonna show her my world. Father. Not about to see your light. But if you wanna find hell with me. I can show you what it's like. Till you're bleeding. Not about to see your light. And if you wanna find hell with me. I can show you what it's like. Mother. Tell your children not to hold my hand. Tell your children not to understand. Mother. Father. Do you wanna bang heads with me. Do you wanna feel everything. Father. Not about to see your light. But if you wanna find hell with me. I can show you what it's like. Till you're bleeding. Not about to see your light. But if you wanna find hell with me. I can show you what it's like. Not about to see your light. But if you wanna find hell with me. I can show you what it's like. Till you're bleeding. Not about to see your light. But if you wanna find hell with me. I can show you what it's like
402,Anberlin,Rock,Come and go now as you please. Your actions write the melodies. To the songs that we sing. And you just sing along. And I finally found that life goes on without you. And the world still turns when you're not around. Is this the way you want it. Is this the way it has to be. Sitting here beside you when my heart's lost in New Orleans. Dreams come clever. Hearts now sever. Difference of forever. And I'm lost there. And I finally found that life goes on without you. And the world still turns when you're not around. And I finally found that life goes on without you. And the world still turns when you're not around. And I finally found out. Your actions write the melodies. To the songs that we sing. Your actions write the melodies. To the songs that we sing. Can you just sing along out loud. Come and go now as you please. Your actions write the melodies. To the songs that we sing. And you just sing along. And I finally found that life goes on without you. And the world still turns when you're not around. And I finally found that life goes on without you. And the world still turns when you're not around. And I finally found out. Your actions write the melodies. To the songs that we sing. Your actions write the melodies. To the songs that we sing. Can you just sing along out loud
403,Anberlin,Rock,Last night rolled over beside my bed. That sort of madness could leave 'em dead. Our eyes deceive we were on fire. Mistook the love and love desire. I still can't feel nothing. Just want to hold something. Tell me again what's real. Tell me again what to feel. I still can't feel nothing. Just want to hold something. Tell me again what's real. Tell me again what to feel. Why do you stay until you see blood. Why does the weight fall upon us. We're on the same side in the same war. Why stay till you see blood. Where are we that we digress. Long for love but then undress. Our hands no bounds our hearts detached. We grasp for all that will not last. I still can't feel nothing. Just want to hold something. Tell me again what's real. Tell me again what to feel. I still can't feel nothing. Just want to hold something. Tell me again what's real. Tell me again what to feel. Why do you stay until you see blood. Why does the weight fall upon us. We're on the same side in the same war. Why stay till you see blood. Fall falter on my chest. Feel failure to progress. Why do you stay until you see blood. Why does the weight fall upon us. We're on the same side in the same war. Why stay till you see blood. I still can't feel nothing. Just want to hold something. Tell me again what's real. Tell me again what to feel. I still can't feel nothing. Just want to hold something. Tell me again what's real. Tell me again what to feel

405,Anberlin,Rock,You wanna watch us break?. Be the first to take us down. But your teeth are worn. And there’s no stopping us now. You got to be mental. Your speeches sound malingered. Take down this molotov of words. Penned with you in mind. Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. You'll crash where you stand. You've got a riot on your hands. Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. Too late to make demands. When you've got a riot on your hands. Silent alarms are ringing. Sounds of revolt draw near. A new united front. That you will come to fear. We will hold together. To become the change. Voice for the voiceless. With every common man engaged. Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. You crash where you stand. You've got a riot on your hands. Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. Too late to make demands. When you’ve got a riot. Ignite and watch us burn. Til every embers turn. Mankind will feel inspired. When we set your walls to fire. Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. You crash where you stand. You've got a riot on your hands. Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. Too late to make demands. When you’ve got a riot
406,Anberlin,Rock,Since when did bullets. Start to sing. It didn't have to end like this. Is this the end of everything. It didn't have to end like this. I feel I feel we can't stop here. It doesn't have to end like this. We owe this to ourselves. We can't just let this go. If every man became a king. We could start it off with this. We could do more than just dream. We could start it off with this. I feel I feel the change is here. We owe this to ourselves. To fight to lead. We can't just let this go
407,Andi Deris,Rock,It's like an open fire. Spreading out. Burning higher. IT's a game. You know the name. Still it goes the same. Like a guiding angel. White in white. Plain essential. For my life. For my mind. Still so much to find. I love you more than I can say. A little bit more each day. Hey I love you. A little bit more each day. I love you. A little bit more each day. It's like a giant cyclone. From a breeze we raised it to storm. And the rain was followed by. Royal in the sky. And it's like every hour. Without you is ache and sorrow. It's a game. You know the name. Still it goes the same. I love you more than I can say. A little bit more each day. Hey I love you. A little bit more each day. Hey I love you. A little bit more each day. I love you. A little bit more each day. I love you more than I can say. Before and after. I love you more than I can say. A little bit more each day. Hey I love you. A little bit more each day. I love you
408,Andi Deris,Rock,Life is what I'm bringing. Pain is what I'm killing. Hope is what you need to give me. Dust to dust and energy to energy. I'm gonna fill up your hearts. I'm gonna fill up your hearts. Now I'm back again. To make you see. Yes I'm back again. I walk on water where was sand. I'm back again. I hope I make you understand. I'm back again. For you. Death is your own decision. Once you dared a timeless mission. Lost in mind and mere forgotten. Sleeps the power you have gotten. I'm gonna fill up your hearts. I'm gonna fill up your hearts. Now I'm back again. To make you see. Yes I'm back again. I walk on water where was sand. I'm back again. I hope I make you understand. I'm back again
409,Andi Deris,Rock,Hey you!. Can you tell me how I achieved to end up here?. Hey you. Are you by my side 'cause you are what you appear. Listen. I don't know why but you still hold my sweet lime. Twisted. I'm feeling good and I don't prossess a dime. The Time Of My Life. Twist and turns like a knife. Turing all that was good into pieces. Skins me alive. The Time Of My Life. Twist and turns like a knife. Turing all that was good into pieces. Cutting all that was plain into pieces. Hello you time of my life. Yeah now. I remember who I most likely used to be. Damn. On my wedding-day I deidec just to flee. Sister. I have no clue who the flying fuck you are. But baby. You're looking good so let's see how cheap you are. The Time Of My Life. Twist and turns like a knife. Turing all that was good into pieces. Skins me alive. The Time Of My Life. Twist and turns like a knife. Turing all that was good into pieces. Cutting all that was plain into pieces. Hello you time of my life
410,Andi Deris,Rock,All I had now is gone. Was not always alone. Not yet shed my last tear. For the child of my fear. What's true for my eyes. Could be all made up in disguise. Once out there now is here. It's the child of my fear. These words I'm singing. These days I'm giving. These tears I'm paying. But my child of fear is staying. On and on. It tells lies over me. Or I'm not what I think to be. Gave up all that was dear. For the child of my fear. Like a silent thief. Stole my faith my belief. What was doubt now is clear. I'm the child of my fear. These words I was singing. These days I was giving. These tears I was paying. But my child of fear was staying. These roads I'd taken. Seemed all mistaken. Now the truth was spoken. And I feel the spell is broken. Gone. Forever gone
411,Andi Deris,Rock,Winter has come. And the snow at the window is. Gray as my mind. I'd want to just leave it all behind. Something is out there I need to find. Dark is the night. And the cold is my enemy I want to hide. But I ain't got no time to free. Sometimes tomorrow I 'll be free. Could I leave forever and a day. I would look for a bay. And would there be forever lasting may. I wouldn't chage a day. Life is a bitch. Too expensive to be your friend. I wanna fly. Far away where the winter ends. Lay down at the beach. And build castles with sand. Could I leave forever and a day. I would look for a bay. And would there be forever lasting may. I wouldn't change a day
412,Andi Deris,Rock,"""My hair touch my shoulders. My eyes are iceblue. I walk in Mom's kitchen. With dirty wet shoes. I eat with my fingers. I like to bite nails. When I'm bored I watch """"Baywatch"""". When everything else fails. I am dangerous. I am dangerous. I am a black Jack. I'm a maniac. I am dangerous. Dangerous. I am dangerous. I am a mad pig. I am a lunatic. I am dangerous. So cold is my longing. Vanilla-chocolate-cream. Willingly the women. I'm hunting in my dreams. I buy me a six-pack. And man I never share. I build car-plastic-models. And blow 'em in the air. Dangerous. I am dangerous. I am a psychopath. I am a wicked ass. I am dangerous. Dangerous. I am dangerous. I am a black Jack. I'm a maniac. I am dangerous. Dangerous. I am a mad pic. Lunatic. Wicked ass. Psychopath. Dangerous"""
413,Andi Deris,Rock,There was a time. There was a place. Where every flash was light and laughter. Did not need any nations. All has been one. But you were bored in paradise. There was not thrill and no adventures. So you began to push me. And now you're gone. Way down I did it all for you. Way down I did it all for you. It's said and done. It's said and done. All you are is light in the sun. Way down I did it all for you. You chose a world in material space. And I promised you independence. But you could always call me. I hear you pray. So many lost their link to me. What was a truth is long forgotten. Now it's time to wake up. And find back home. Way down I did it all for you. Way down I did it all for you. It's said and done. It's said and done. All you are is light in the sun. Way down I did it all for you
414,Andi Deris,Rock,Time is a healer. For everything that hurts inside. For things you've been going through. Stealing your pride. Making you cry. I'm picking up the pieces. Of what I once felt inside. A world full of promises. And memories cut like a knife. Do you really wanna know. The way that I feel. Though you've been such a long time. Running away. You really wanna know. That I'd beg and steal. Though I don't really know if you. Remember me. Love is a dealer. Selling your heart and soul. Taking your everything. When you can't give enough. When you're starting to fall. I'm the pretender. Pretending i'm doing fine. But nothing makes sense to me. Cause there are mountains between us. Made of space and time. Do you really wanna know. The way that I feel. Though you've been such a long time. Running away. you really wanna know. That I'd beg and steal. Though I don't really know if you. Remember me. All the pain and the sorrows. All the echoes of promises. Make me feel I'm eternally. Lost and never found. Do you really wanna know. The way that I feel. Though you've been such a long time. Running away. You really wanna know. That I'd beg and steal. Though I don't really know if you. Remember me
415,Andi Deris,Rock,Should I break like my father?. Should I cry like my mother?. Had I stayed with the others. I had not found my brothers. Free. Yeah we are free. Had I followed my teachers. Like the christian the preachers. I had not cut the wire. Which tied up my desire. Free. yeah we are free. Free. yeah we are free. I want to fly. I want to be. I want to kiss eternity. I have a dream. I have a time. Tomorrow is a friend of mine. To you and me. We are free. Yeah we are free. We are free. Free
416,Andi Deris,Rock,Goodbye Jenny – Andi Deris. (Deris) Come In From the Rain/1997. Jenny had a white heart. Now her face is red with blood. Your eyes that I known laughtin. Stare unto the rot. Jenny went your last way. On a cold and rainy day. She didn’t want to live forever. She didn’t want to live forever. But she didn’t want to go today.

418,Andi Deris,Rock,Somewhere when I'm dead and gone. I will stand there justifying. Was I living my life for. The shadowside or was I shining. Many times I drove in. The wrong way for long. But those who kept moving. Forever last home. They follow the evil. I knew that they would. I don't believe in the good. I don't believe in the good. Don't believe in the good. I don't believe. I got no reason I should. No belief in the good. I don't believe. Honesty is dying. Inasmuch as corruption grows. Poverty's incresing. Where the big lie is sold. Now the strong are climbing. The weak are falling down. But I know what happens. When masses hit the ground. A new revolution to add in the books. I don't believe in the good. I don't believe in the good. Don't believe in the good. I don't believe. I got no reason I should. No belief in the good. I don't believe. In you
419,Andi Deris,Rock,Johnny you see all about tomorrow. Then when the night has come you look up to the sky. Johnny you see all about the sorrows. You wait for a sign to come. You wait for a sign to come. Johnny you'll be taunted like a messiah. When the cross kills again the answer's gone with you. Johnny you are chosen for the higher. Wait for your time to come. You wait for your time to come. In the lights of the sky. Stand all the secrets of the sky. Why are we all so blind?. There's something nearby. Something nearby. In the lights of the sky. Johnny you know all about the fire. Then when the shadows die you see the world in flames. Johnny you know they will call you liar. Then you know your time to come. Then you know your time to come. In the lights of the sky. Stand all the secrets of the sky. Why are we all so blind?. There's something nearby. Something nearby. In the lights of the sky. . by /morphine_
420,Andi Deris,Rock,Listen brothers and sisters. I know that you cry. There is you and no others. And damn you know why. Do you know what I mean?. Do you know what I mean?. Hey you what do you do?. Follow me and let your love fly free. Hold on let's get it done. Follow me and let your love fly free. Let your love fly free. Do you flee when it's calling?. Or suffer in pain?. Did you ever try to face it. And call it by name?. Do you feel what you feel?. Really feel what you feel?. Hey you what do you do?. Follow me and let your love fly free. Hold on let's get it done. Follow me and let your love fly free. Let your love fly free
421,Andi Deris,Rock,When I close my eyes just for a while. I gaze another sphere. Like a different life not far away. But definitely not here. I must be dreaming. There I am a king of just myself. Abode to rule my life. And the Queen I love is begging me. To finally arrive. I must be sleeping. I must be dreaming. I must be sleeping. I must be dreaming. All this life. I must be dreaming. On throught my life. There are bigger trees and smaller names. The first must walk behind. They help up the weak and ease their pain. The chore on the devine. I must be dreaming. I must be sleeping. I must be dreaming. All this life. On through my life
422,Andi Deris,Rock,You make me go through your changes. Already gave you my heart and my everything. Now you turn away. You made me tell you my deepest fears. By the faith I had in you yesterday. Where's it all gone today?. But now that I know this ain't love. I still haven't closed it enough. Shouldn't feel the way that I just do. Shouldn't feel that way. But now that I know this ain't love. I still can't get enough. It's like the dying of fire. Like the wind blowing words to nowhere. Nothing left to say. And in that morning when you'll be gone. I'll sit down with a pack of cigarettes. Waiting you come home. Now that I know this ain't love. I still haven't closed it enough. Shouldn't feel the way that I just do. Shouldn't feel that way. But now that I know this ain't love. I still can't get enough
423,Andi Deris,Rock,It's not right to make me believe you. To see white though it's black to the eye. It's so loud in my head. From things you have said. Don't try to drive me mad. Don't think I'm coming knock on your door. For you know I have now declared you war. I won't be crawling on the floor. Take those tears from your eyes. They taste like lies. Take those tears from your eyes. They taste like lies. Out of sight out of remembrance. Yeah I know just like I knew before. You have wrapped me in light. Made me go blind. No more you'll twist my mind. No do not have that look in your eyes. I cannot take no more of your lies. It's enough of your disguise. Take those tears from your eyes. They taste like lies. Take those tears from your eyes. They taste like lies
424,Andi Deris,Rock,Grey days. To be or not to be. Who are we. It's a mistery. Always. We have bleeded for. The Grail of life. Though it's just next door. The best you don't need to pay for. The best you don't wait to come. The best you don't need to pay for. Always on the run. Time flies. Many thousand years. And slowly. The stupor disappears. People. Stand up one by one. To find out. What makes the world go round. The best you don't need to pay for. The best you don't need to buy. The best you don't need to pay for. Recall and realise. The best you don't need to fight for. The best you don't wait to come. The best you don't need to pay for. Always on the run. The best you don't need to pay for
425,Andi Deris,Rock,I am watching everyone. What you do and hide. Got megalenses inside. Joined with high-tech mind. All that's running. That's hiding. I'm finding. I'm the king of 7 eyes. The king of 7 eyes. I'm computing what you say. By my picture files. I change the human world to a. Planet earth exile. All that's running. That's hiding. I'm finding. I'm the king of 7 eyes. The king of 7 eyes. I'm the king. I'm the king
426,Andi Deris,Rock,Hey you!. Can you tell me how I achieved to end up here?. Hey you. Are you by my side 'cause you are what you appear. Listen. I don't know why but you still hold my sweet lime. Twisted. I'm feeling good and I don't prossess a dime. The Time Of My Life. Twist and turns like a knife. Turing all that was good into pieces. Skins me alive. The Time Of My Life. Twist and turns like a knife. Turing all that was good into pieces. Cutting all that was plain into pieces. Hello you time of my life. Yeah now. I remember who I most likely used to be. Damn. On my wedding-day I deidec just to flee. Sister. I have no clue who the flying fuck you are. But baby. You're looking good so let's see how cheap you are. The Time Of My Life. Twist and turns like a knife. Turing all that was good into pieces. Skins me alive. The Time Of My Life. Twist and turns like a knife. Turing all that was good into pieces. Cutting all that was plain into pieces. Hello you time of my life
427,Andi Deris,Rock,There's a modern religion. Proclaiming the pain. Promising immortal wonders. They steal his power. Disparage his name. Turn the holy words to thunder. We don't know where they go from here. But in the dark they wait. They are fallen believers. Betrayed in their faith. By the church war for the true god. They turn old secrets. No nowadays lies. Pushing us to praise the new Lord. We don't know where they go from here. But in the dark they wait. They wait. They abuse your illusions. They know 'bout your dreams. Take advantage of your frustrations. They spread their fever. Quiet and mean. Recruiting trusting new retrievers. We don't know where they go form here. But in the dark they wait. They wait. In the dark they wait. They wait. One day they're coming. Theirs is the time. One day they're coming. They wait. They wait. They wait. In the dark they wait
428,Andi Deris,Rock,Time is standing still. My mind moves on against my will. Life itself goes blind. But leaves a cell where I just find. You. I know form a distance. But how could this be true?. I see myself come closing in. It's calling me. It's calling me. Who am I. If you are me?. When I die. Where will yo be?. Who am I. Who am I?. Let's me go away. I fear this palce and all it's night. Help me to awake. I swear this time I'll stand and fight. Wait. Help me please understand before you start. To fade. Time begins to tick again. I'm falling home. I'm falling home. Who am I. If you are me?. When I die. Where will you be?. Who you are. And what you'll be. Is that my reality?. Who am I. Who am I?
429,Angra,Rock,Sorry!. You're nothing but an illusion. You're just a mind projecting our world. Worries are nothing but conclusions. Worries are lies deterring your rebirth. You are the silent bliss. Behind the abyss of thoughts. Of conscious minds. Sorrow!. Are faces on the mirror. Millions of hearts and names ethereal. You are the quiet dream that's always been. Before the seas of time. Shed all the fears. And trust the universe. Light of transcendence. The real perception. It's all in our hands to trust the universe. Light of transcendence. The human conception comes. Conception comes!. Shed all the fears. And trust the universe. Light of transcendence. A real perception. It's all in our hands to trust the universe. Light of transcendence. Human conception comes. A brand new world. Conception comes!

We were draining the poisoned sea. Though the scenes were indeed too sad. Only prayers will take the lead. Oh! Just one of us survived. At least a discent woman and a man. Wide awake! Am I alone in this place?. Someone hear me? My only hope!. The acid rain is burning. Right into your eyes. Again your dreams may lose the glow. Allow the sorrow of your thougths to meet sunrise.

431,Angra,Rock,Inside the cage of your mind. Waiting for the day. Just a victim of the guilt. Living in despair. Out on your own in the dark. Sinners meet the saints. Bloody river overflows. You don't really care. Setting on fire. Your own freedom. Played the hardest game. Now you will burn. Your eternal flame. Even the brave won't deny. Evil warns again. And your conscience isn't safe. Driving you insane. Playing with fire. Put your freedom. Through the hardest test. Don't blame the scar. On your final day. One last minute passes by your soul. Just one minute lost in the horizon. You will face the judgement day. (Scream your voice free to the air). Waiting for the judgement day. One last minute passes by your soul. Just one minute lost in the horizon. One more minute passes by your eyes. Just one minute less in the horizon. Then you face the judgement day. (Scream your voice free to the air). There'll no more time to pray. (Sweat in pain you are afraid). We all face the judgement day

434,Angra,Rock,Out in the dark I roam. Onward to meet my fate. Time's an illusion today. Away from all I know. A frail that is filled with pain. Feeling the lifeless taste ahead. I wish for no more than air. Flashes of clearness cross my eyes. Disclosing power. The tides will hurry my return. Now in the blackness I see light. I will not cower. I contemplate life with helpless faith. Master of my design I am. Awake from darkness. Pages of wisdom turn. Mind over matter reigns. my fear won't lead me astray. I seek the quiet night. Over the crushing waves. I imagine thoughts on golden rays. And days when I'll rise again. Flashes of clearness cross my eyes. Disclosing power. The tides will hurry my return. Now in the blackness I see light. I will not cower. I contemplate life with helpless faith. Master of my design I am. Awake from darkness I am. Awake from darkness. A broken dignity. An upsurge soon to be. Within these books I find my hope. And liberty. Flashes of clearness cross my eyes. Revealing power. The tides will hurry my return. When in the blackness I see light. My soul won't cower. I contemplete life with helpless faith. Staring into a brighter day. I see the fields which once were black. Master of my design I am. Awake from darkness I am. Awake from darkness. Crédito: Leonardo K'Dash

437,Angra,Rock,Demian poor child was raised on the gutter. Digs in thrashcans to kill the hunger. When your mouth is so full of promisse. All I see is one empty hand. The world may turn but. some things never change. Uptown princess a life inside cages. Wearing diamonds around the neck. I know bibles are full of fair words. But nothing's worth more. Than what to care. The world keeps turning (and) still things. stay the same. You look away while i see the.... Eyes of Christ on a devil's face. Eyes of Christ on a devil's face. Wait for your heart to show the way. Turn your old mind from flesh to clay. I beg for a Miracle. We've made'em heroes. We've made'em warriors. We've made their mothers cry. We've got our defence. We've got our difference. We're playing different sides. You die someday and still. the world will be the same. Now you understand when i see the.... Eyes of Christ on a devil's face. Eyes of Christ on a devil's face. Driving a knife in your despair. May become blind the ones who stare. Look to the. Eyes of Christ on a devil's face. Eyes of Christ on a devil's face. Setting on fire those who pray. Blinding the eyes of human race. Please beg for a miracle!
438,Angra,Rock,Slavery kings run free again. From their wounds a giant stands. Four hundred years of glory. Animals who speak and cry. Destiny of craving sights. Inside the dance of white domain. Wheels turning round will feed the ground. And women carry by their children with no life. To future days belongs the past. But change the times. Now millions cry out. From away it comes.... Freedom call. Freedom overall to last forever. No disgrace. No more separate race. We'll keep together 'till the end

443,Angra,Rock,Remember the first time you've faced the dark. Why were you so afraid?. Hiding so many secrets inside. When fears have got to be tamed. I promise I'll still be there. To keep my promise. I'll still be there. To watch over dreams at night. And follow you through the day. You shut the doors but I'm right behind. Where shadows remain. I promise I'll still be there. To say I promise. I'll still be there. Don't ask me why we'll be like brothers. Skating on the ice of mortal loneliness. Live and learn with your minds. Find a way out of madness. You dream on paradise. Who's gonna take you there?
444,Angra,Rock,An eagle breaks the silence. And overflies the field. My eyes will try to follow. Till it vanishes away. Like candles in the darkness. Who fight against the wind. Devotion to your idols. Soon will overthrow the king. Out of order. Taming borders. Tearing down the fences. On and on and after all. The century has gone. Racism jumble. Turbulence. My eyes believe we have gone to the end. Ordinary Earth. Sailing through the space. Population alienation. Losin all affection. Calling on to heaven's hope. To watch for my protection. Out of luck. Potential stuck. Remote controlled. By the T.V. again. Carries human souls. Lead us to the journey of our fate. So come millennium sun. Won't you show us the way. Future's begun. So words from my mouth come. Whispering for your return. Pictures a sunset on the lake. Mirros of crystal your portrait. Walking on this field while I wait. So come millennium sun. Won't you show us the way. Future's begun. So words from my mouth come. Whispering for your return. Show us the future's begun. Burning millennium sun
445,Angra,Rock,So now I see. How nice it could be. To rocket through the star. Like a fire bullet through the sky. Beautiful sight. Silent and bizarre. Wonder where you are. Rocket like a bullet through the sky. Circling on orbit through the night. Peace of mind - not so far away. Till I find my way back home. So close to me. Reaching out - to learn how good life is. Living in a world like this. So close to me. Our blue marbles just a grain of sand. And the universe is waiting for us there. Out of this world.... Into the darknest night. Hoping that I´m not alone. People are lost on that solid ground. And there´s something I want you to know. We are slowly destroying this world. No other planet. Nowhere is better than here. Into the night. Out of this world. Spinning around the night. Seeing the people so small. I see how much we have screwed our lives. And there´s something I´m trying to say. There´ll be no second chance for our race. Circled horizons. Staring at our lonely world. Into the night. Like a fire bullet through the sky. When I find my way back home
446,Angra,Rock,Faster than a bullet. Terrifying scream. Enraged and full of anger. He is half man and half machine. Rides the metal monster. Breathing smoke and fire. Closing in with vengeance soaring high. He is the painkiller. This is the painkiller. Planets devastated. Mankind's on its knees. A saviour comes from out the skies. In answer to their pleas. Through boiling clouds if thunder. Blasting bolts of steel. Evils going under deadly wheels. He is the painkiller. This is the painkiller. Faster than a lazer bullet. Louder than an atom bomb. Chromium plated boiling metal. Brighter than a thousand suns. Flying high on rapture. Stronger free and brave. Nevermore encaptured. They've been brought back from the grave. With mankind resurrected. Forever to survive. Returns from Armageddom to the skies
447,Angra,Rock,Now all the secrets you have learned. Got to be shared with everyone around. It's by your acts that the things that you know. Turn into facts and build a bridge of love. And once you understand. So simple and profound. The future's in your hands. Go spread the word around. Stars are calling you. With a message to the world. Telling how our soul will survive. Perfect symmetry. Give the message to the world. Share your love and reach for the skies. Why do you refuse to trust?. Your tiny mind against the universe. And all the rest of you. Who are laughing at me now. What's said might not ne true. Go see what will be found. Stars are calling you. With a message to the world. Telling how our soul will survive. Perfect symmetry. Give the message to the world. Share your love and reach for the skies
448,Angra,Rock,The moonlit sky. The daylight unveils the secret place. Gaze covered in roses. High in silent glaze. I hear you breathe. Sizing the wind I lead in me. Into paradise I come for you. I'll forever return. Angels will call our names. They take us into the garden of dreams. And than your eyes meet mine. The light it shines will never die. Sing with me. The lullaby that sets me free. All my fears fading. Your sweet embrace. Talk to me. Make all my sorrows disappear. In my dark hours I come to you. I'll forever return. Angels will call our names. They'll take us into the garden of dreams. And than your eyes meet mine. The light it shines will never die. Come meet me tonight. Come to our secret garden. Hide with me. Hide in your arms hold me forever. Come meet me tonight. Come to our secret garden. Hide with me. Hide by your side hold me forever. In your arms. Angels will call our names. They'll take us into the garden of dreams. And than your eyes meet mine. The light it shines will never die. The light it shine will never die
449,Angra,Rock,He deals the cards as a meditation. And those he plays never suspect. He doesn't play for the money he wins. He doesn't play for respect. He deals the cards to find the answer. The sacred geometry of chance. The hidden law of a probable outcome. The numbers lead a dance. I know that the spades are swords of a soldier. I know that the clubs are weapons of war. I know that diamonds mean money for this art. But that's not the shape of my heart. He may play the jack of diamonds. He may lay the queen of spades. He may conceal a king in his hand. While the memory of it fades. I know that the spades are swords of a soldier. I know that the clubs are weapons of war. I know that diamonds mean money for this art. But that's not the shape of my heart. And if I told you that I loved you. You'd maybe think there's something wrong. I'm not a man of too many faces. The mask I wear is one. Those who speak know nothing. And find out to their cost. Like those who curse their luck in too many places. And those who fear are lost. I know that the spades are swords of a soldier. I know that the clubs are weapons of war. I know that diamonds mean money for this art. But that's not the shape of my heart. But that's not the shape of my heart. But that's not the shape...shape of my heart
450,Angra,Rock,"""Wake up my friend today life will show the answers. It's time for you to face the risk. Dark clouds will go away. They know your fears 'cause your mind can't hide connections. And disturb the harmony. From you to let it fade. Let it out! Let it go!. Grab the chances you've been waiting for so long. Let it out! Take control!. Find your way towards the places you belong. Wake up my friend you're in charge of your connections. It's time for you to face the day. Dark clouds have gone away. All the paths you have known well. Or maybe never seemed to care. The minute you wake up. Let it out! Let it go!. Grab the chances you've been waiting for so long. Let it out! Take control!. Find your way towards the places you belong. I'll wait 'till the storm of emotions tears these tides. Afraid that the strong clouds of sorrow. Would haze my sight. And blind my eyes. Let it out! Let it go!. Grab the chances you've been waiting for so long. Let it out! Take control!. Find your way towards the places you belong. Let it out! Let it go!. Grab the chances you've been waiting for so long. Let it out! Take control!. Find your way towards the places you belong. """"Just wait the chances you've been waiting for so long. Please wait and find your way towards the places you belong""""(2x)"""

455,Angra,Rock,Viderunt te aquae. Deus viderunt te aquae. Et timuerunt. Et turbatae. Sunt abyssi
456,Angra,Rock,Caught in space and time. Like a bird in a cage. Cruelly confined. In a passing matters state. You suddenly realize. That the wrong is the right. Daring the laws. Ready to put up a fight. But.... Love will drag your heart away. To a world where dreams are made. Can't hide away. When your helpless mind obeys. Together we wait in silence. (Still are the cries). Forever the fate is hungry. for your soul. Together we wait in silence. (Still are the cries). Worth your while until you're gone. All the secrets of life reveal. To my eyes I can't conceal. And again I fly away. To a world where dreams are made. Together we wait in silence. (Still are the cries). Forever the fate is hungry. for your soul. Together we wait in silence. (Still are the cries). Worth your while until you're gone. Life's too short to grieve in sorrow. (Still are the cries). Fate is waiting for your soul. (Secrets inside). Live your life like no tomorrow. (Still are the cries). Worth you're while until gone. Fate's gonna take your soul!
457,Angra,Rock,No doubts!. You’re the result of the chances you take. Face the circumstance!. Have you become who you wished to be?. Resigning to what you loved and cared. There’s no way out!. Memories will come to remind you some day. How it could have been. Through every door you will step in. Another choice you’re stuck between. Don’t look back. Just make your way ahead. A window to nowhere. The void in which I stare. Now that I’ve come so far where do I go from here?. Decision just came in time. A new door is open. You have to go again… decide!. You finally realize. The whole world you’re facing. The window of your life… good bye!. A window to nowhere. Wide-eyed in great despair. Now that I’ve come so far where do I go from here?. Life is drowned in fears. The river of my tears. Please hold my trembling hands before I go insane all again. . (fonte: site oficial)

465,Asking Alexandria,Rock,I'm alive. Watch yourself I'm taking over. The cracks in the pavement don't break my stride. I step lightly. I step lightly. I'm alive. I can't believe what I've become. I won't stop breathing. Your world is falling at your feet. I won't stop breathing. Oh my god. I can't believe what I've become. I won't stop breathing. Your world is falling at your feet. I won't stop breathing. Just 'cause you're breathing. Don't mean you're alive. Excuses are useless. When your mouth's stapled shut. I can't believe what I've become. I can't believe. I can't believe what I've become. I can't believe. You're drowning in the back room. So this is what it feels to waltz. You're drowning in the back room. So this is what it feels to waltz.

I know there's something more. I've heard it all before. But I won't sing my last song. 'Til I'm flat out on the floor. I've longed for so much more. I wanna be the best that I can be. I'm sick and tired of being admired. I don't deserve this pedestal you've put me on. All I want is to be proud of who I am. I brought this hell upon myself. Now I gotta see it through 'til the end

488,Autoramas,Rock,Pessoa solitária. Que anda pela rua de madrugada. Atrás de gente interessante. Só não sei se tem gente interessada. Gerando comentários na sala de aula na segunda-feira. De quem só viu por um minuto e projeta uma vida inteira. Você sabe tão pouco a meu respeito. Mas se sente no direito de vir me analisar. Se é pra passar por cima de preconceito. Prefiro nem ser aceito. O que eu quero pra minha vida é muito mais!. Você nem imagina é muito mais. O que eu quero pra minha vida é muito mais!. Você nem imagina é muito mais. O que eu quero pra minha vida é muito mais!. Pessoa solitária. Que anda pela rua de madrugada. Atrás de gente interessante. Só não sei se tem gente interessada. Passando pelo crivo. de quem julga uma coisa pela embalagem. De quem não se espera mais nada. do que uma mente de curta metragem. Você sabe tão pouco a meu respeito. Mas se sente no direito de vir me analisar. Se é pra passar por cima de preconceito. Prefiro nem ser aceito. O que eu quero pra minha vida é muito mais!. Você nem imagina é muito mais. O que eu quero pra minha vida é muito mais!. Você nem imagina é muito mais. O que eu quero pra minha vida é muito mais!
489,Autoramas,Rock,Era pra eu estar deslumbrado. Com tantas opções que ficam na minha frente. Não consigo ficar acostumado. São muitas novidades que aparecem de repente. Chega de tanta liberdade. Tem gente que nasceu pra ser obediente. Mundo Moderno. Me tirem desse inferno. são tantas coisas novas pra experimentar. Alguém me ponha no. meu devido lugar. Mundo Moderno. Convivo com o medo enorme. que alguma idéia diferente apareça. então eu preciso de ordens. Antes que algo de ruim me aconteça. Pra tantos lados pode ir minha ambição. Mas vou jogar pro alto o que eu tenho nas minhas mãos. Mundo Moderno. Me tirem desse inferno. são tantas coisas novas pra experimentar. Alguém me ponha no meu devido lugar. Mundo Moderno

496,Autoramas,Rock,Como pode um dia lindo assim trazer. Noticias cinzas como céu de chuva. Como pode a primavera em mim morrer. Deixar as minhas ilusões viúvas. Por pequeno que isso tudo possa ser. Só uma gota deixa a água turva. O que eu descobri de você. O que eu descobri sem querer. Passando na cabeça. Como um rolo compressor. Faz com que eu esqueça. O lado bom do amor. Como pode o céu azul escurecer. Forçar o sol a me negar ajuda. O planeta já não pode mais conter. O choro agora que tudo inunda. Você chama de exagero e pode ser. Mas tempestades começam miudas.

510,Badfinger,Rock,In younger days I told myself. My life would be my own. And I'd leave the place where sunshine never shone. For my life's too short for waiting. When I see the rising sun. Then I know again. That I must carry on. Carry on till tomorrow. There's no reason to look back. Carry on. Beyond the shadows of the clouds. And onward to the sky. Carry on till I find the rainbow's end. For my life's too short for waiting. When I see the rising sun. Then I know again. That I must carry on. Carry on till tomorrow. There's no reason to look back. Carry on. Drifting on the wings of freedom. Leave this stormy day. And we'll ride to tomorrow's golden field. For my life's too short for waiting. When I see the rising sun. Then I know again. That I must carry on. Carry on. And when the heavy journey's done. I'll rest my weary head. For the world and all its colors will be mine. For my life's too short for waiting. When I see the rising sun. Then I know again. That I must carry on. Carry on till tomorrow. There's no reason to look back. Carry on. Carry on

520,Badfinger,Rock,Beneath the midnight caller. She thinks of paper green. You never hear them calling her name. They just know where they've been. You never hear them holler. The tears no longer come. She reads a daily book of her past. That shows of everyone. Greys that show in her hair. Can't be but don't seem to care. She locks the door. And there's no one there.

530,Banda Base,Rock,Ele fugiu e nem pensa em voltar atrás. Fingindo correr para não perder o seu lugar. Só se fala quando não há chances de errar. Mostrando a coragem sentado em seu sofá. Mas vendo assim de perto. O tempo não descança mas. Deixamos tudo pro final. E se a cara é de pau. A paciência não passa. A história nos conta. É foda que não se estende a mão. Mas também não se cala. Só o tempo que fala. às vezes discordo por nada. E a gente espera o progresso. Fazendo o mesmo. Sem nada de novo. Dando tudo de bom. A troco de nada. . Ela sorriu e já tem alguém para lhe ajudar. Fingindo não ser e esquecendo o que será. Corre e desiste antes que se possa começar. Mostrando a coragem sentada em seu sofá
531,Banda Base,Rock,A perfeição é a sua cara. Mas não temos medo. Esperteza não é tudo. Seu cansaço anda ao meu lado. E quase sempre me convence. Que não fazemos o bastante. As vezes o fraco enfraquece. É obvio agente se esquece. As vezes o que se perdeu. É o que ainda não está perdido. O progresso não nos deixa atalhos. E o futuro encontra fila. O tempo enferruja os sonhos. E o que falta é coragem? Será?. . A razão se rendeu ao absurdo. E sem tentar olhar para trás. Se arrasta lenta e sem vontade. A verdade só encontra um lado. E insiste em nos dizer. Mas nem sempre é o bastante
532,Banda Upfive,Rock,Bota fé no pai. Bota fé no pai nego que o inimigo vai cair. Tu nasceu foi pra vencer e nem pensar em desistir. Não conte para Deus o tamanho do seu problema. Conte pro seu problema o tamanho do seu Deus. Pois se você bota fé o inimigo cai. Deus te faz lutar na guerra tipo um samurai. Tipo aquele filme do gladiador. Se no final você morrer. Foi por que você lutou. Mas fique tranquilo que a promessa. Não morre não. Isso é prometido desde a epoca de abraão. Deus tem promessa pra você meu irmão. Mas seja corajoso e não um vacilão. Mas poderes vem mais responsabilidades. Pra vencer o inimigo Deus vai te dar habilidades. Mas mantenha o seu foco e a cabeça sempre em pé. O resto é com Deus e com o tamanho da sua fé. Bota fé no pai. Que o inimigo cai. Bota fé no pai. Que o inimigo cai. Bota fé no pai. Que o inimigo cai. Bota fé no pai. A guerra começou não podemos dar mole não. A bandeira do inimigo é minha fonte de inspiração. Meu combustível é minha fé aqui. Minha confiança é no jeová nisso. Que já me deu a estratégia para vencer o mau. Se o capeta tentar comigo ele vai se dar mal. A guerra não é contra sangue e nem carnal. Essa lei que vem de Deus que é nosso general. Se aliste pra batalha pra guerra espiritual. Cê vai ganhar uma força muito animal. Bota fé no pai que tudo vai ficar legal. Unção que vem de Deus é muito especial. Bota fé no pai. Que o inimigo cai. Bota fé no pai que o inimigo cai. Bota fé no pai. Que o inimigo cai. Bota fé no Pai
533,Banda Www,Rock,O paraíso é azul turquesa. E pontilhado de coral. Um quadro da mãe natureza. Feito de água sol e sal. Este lugar que eu encontrei. Pertence a um mundo diferente. E a cada linha que tracei. Ficou marcado em minha mente. Será que eu to ficando louco!. Ou to vivendo duas vidas. Quero sonhar só mais um pouco. To com saudades das Maldivas. Alguns caminhos que rasguei. O mar abriu à minha frente. Para esta vida que deixei. Quero voltar eternamente. Viver o mundo que provei. È minha única saída. Trabalhar é bom eu sei. Mas vida é pra ser vivida. Será que eu to ficando louco!. Ou to vivendo duas vidas. Quero sonhar só mais um pouco. To com saudades das Maldivas (x2). by→Duda TZ

E a cada linha que tracei. Ficou marcado em minha mente. Será que eu to ficando louco!. Ou to vivendo duas vidas. Quero sonhar só mais um pouco. To com saudades das Maldivas. Alguns caminhos que rasguei. O mar abriu à minha frente. Para esta vida que deixei. Quero voltar eternamente. Viver o mundo que provei. È minha única saída. Trabalhar é bom eu sei. Mas vida é pra ser vivida. Será que eu to ficando louco!. Ou to vivendo duas vidas. Quero sonhar só mais um pouco. To com saudades das Maldivas (x2). by→Duda TZ

538,Barba Grunge,Rock,Posso te falar besteira ao pé do ouvido. E agradecer por você estar comigo. Felicidade é saber. Que eu tenho você. Como é bom lembrar aquele primeiro beijo. Eu lembro da sua roupa. E do seu cheiro. Quero te mostrar o sentimento. Que nasceu em mim. Como doeu. Todo esse tempo. Te olhando nos lugares. E não te tendo. Vou te mostrar. Como eu te amei. E sempre vou. Te amar
539,Barba Grunge,Rock,Não sei mais distinguir. O que é certo ou errado. O mundo está ao contrário. Eu vejo ódio eu vejo rancor. E me pergunto aonde está o amor?. Aonde está o amor. A muita violência. Muito rancor. O sol não brilha mais. E a escuridão tomou. A maior parte daqui. E não se pode mais fugir. [eu fecho os meus olhos. Faço um pedido. Que não falte forças. Pra enfrentar o destino]. [não vejo mais. Não sinto mais o amor. O mundo está ao contrário]

The sound goes round and we start to climb. The lips curl up and it kills my line. The beat is steal and the scene is sown. I see her eyes and her eyes are blown.

545,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Intergalactic Planetary Planetary Intergalactic Another Dimension. Don't you tell me to smile. You stick around I'll make it worth your while. Got numbers beyond what you can dial. Maybe it's because I'm so versatile. Style profile I said. It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child. From the Hudson River out to the Nile. I run the marathon 'til the very last mile. If you battle me I will revile. People always say my style is wild. You've got gall you've got guile. To step to me I'm a rapophile. If you want to battle you're in denial. Coming from Uranus to check my style. Go ahead put my rhymes on trial. Cast you off into exile. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Jazz and Awol that's our team. Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene. When it comes to beats well I'm a fiend. I like my sugar with coffee and cream. Got to keep it going keep it going full steam. Too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean. On the tough guy style I'm not too keen. To try to change the world I will plot and scheme. Mario C likes to keep it clean. Gonna shine like a sunbeam. Keep on rapping cause that's my dream. Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes. When it comes to envy y'all is green. Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine. Another dimension new galaxy. Intergalactic planetary. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. From the family tree of old school hip hop. Kick off your shoes and relax your socks. The rhymes will spread just like a pox. Cause the music is live like an electric shock. I am known to do the Wop. Also known for the Flintstone Flop. Tammy D getting biz on the crop. Beastie Boys known to let the beat drop. When I wrote graffiti my name was Slop. If my rap's soup my beats is stock. Step from the tables as I start to chop. I'm a lumber jack Dj Adrock. If you try to knock me you'll get mocked. I'll stir fry you in my wok. Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop. Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Another dimension do I

562,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost. She's slippin through his fingers as she's movin' out to the coast. If your world was all black and if your world was all white. Then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right. Nicknamed Shamrock my name is not Shamus. Girlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous. My name is not O'Houigheighi Norisit Brian. If I said that I was weak you know I'd be lyin'. Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it. *If you explain to a musician. he'll tell that he knows it but he just can't do it*.

His name's Mike D. not Fat Morton Jelly Roll. M.C. Busy Le Disco fooled around in Fresno. Got over on your girl cause you know she never says no. Well Mike D. is a special individual. Pulling out knots pulling in residuals. Go to the movies get the Rolos the cholos riding slow and low. Mike on the mic and bust with the solo. Mike my stromy don't be so selfish. Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish
564,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,New York New York it's a hell of a town. The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down. They don't know my name they only know my initials. Building bombs in the attic for elected officials. I quit my job I cut my hair. I cut my boss cause I don't care. You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle. You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle. Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of. You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off. Like a buffalo soldier I'm broader than Broadway. Keep keepin' on I don't care what they say. I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors. I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I am the holder of the 3-pack Bonanza. If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped. I am the keeper of the 3-pack Bonanza. If you ask a question you will get the answer. Her breast I saw I reached I felt. M.O.N.E.Y. the belt. I stay at home just like a hermit. I got the jammy but I don't got the permit. Yes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is Slick Nick. that is why Annabelle you're caught with the shrimpy limp dick trick. I ride around town cause my ride is fly. I shot a man in Brooklyn *just to watch him die*.
565,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Chinese eyes and Chinese suits. Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots. More updated on the hip-hop lingo. My favorite New York Knick was Hawthorne Wingo. Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card. You know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte. Peepin' out the colors I be buggin' on Cezanne. They call me Mike D Joe Blow the Lover Man. Your face turns red as your glass of wine. You spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time. Girl you should be with me you should drop that bum. Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Striped Gum. With that big round butt of yours. I'd like to butter your muffin I'm not bluffin'. Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin'.
566,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle. I laid the bait and then she took the tackle. Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster. Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter. I never met a girl that was too finicky. If the press has their way then they're going to finish me. You might know this but you've never been this see. If I ate spinach then I'd be called Spinach D. I shed light like cats shed fur. Ride around town like Raymond Burr. I'm so high that they call me Your Highness. If you don't know me then pardon my shyness. I live in the Village wherever I go I walk to. Keepin' my friends around so I have someone to talk to. I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it. It's a trip it's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it.
567,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the Dr. Hfuhruhurr Ale. I've got nothing to lose so I'm pissin' on the third rail. Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station. D-Train ride Coney Island vacation. Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train. They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine. Jump the turnstyle I lost my last token. Riding between the cars pissing smoking. Also finger popping. Two bums fucking I seen them rocking. Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout. Policeman told my homeboy put that crack out. You know you light up when the lights go down. Read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown. Same faces every day but you don't know their names. Party people going placed on the D-Train. French trench coat wing tip going to work. Pulling a train like Captain Kirk. Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts. Caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz. Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor. Prostitutes spandex caught in the ding dong doors. Stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity. Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity. $50.00 fine for disturbing the peace. The neck tortoise the Lees creased. Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin. Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin. Elevated platform never gonna conform. Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm. Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes. Over the loud speaker about the hard times. Sat across from a man readin El Diario. Riding the train down from El Barrio. Went from the station straight to Orange Julius. Bought a hot dog from my man George Drakoulias.

Plank Bee. Me and my crew out breaking windows. The bingo the lotto you know I'll never win those. Possession is half the law. I had my routines before all y'all. Your whole life is coming apart at the seams. You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines. I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie. Right now I wish I had another hash brownie. Like Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass. Or Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass. You try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat. *See personally I wouldn't want to go out like that*. I'm a writer a poet a genius I know it. I don't buy cheeba I grow it. *I'm a farmer* people always trying to get next to me. But I'm down with Jalil Donkey and Ecstasy. Smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer. Because I had to deal with a money hungry miser. Had a caine filled Kool with my man Rush Rush. Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush. You be doing nose candy on the Bowie Coke Mirror. My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her. You can't deny me you always want to try me. You're just gonna get your ass kicked. Homeboy throw in the towel. Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell. The Godfather of Soul is in the belly of the beast. For smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast. Sometimes you've got to let someone trip on their own shoelace before you tell them to tie their shoe. All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters. Sitting in the White House pulling their peters. Buy me cheeba from the cop down the street. The only cop with a rope chain walking the beat. Like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'. Like the beat to my rhyme just kickin'. Space cake cookies I discover who I am. I'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man. Five-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains. Said good-bye to my girl my lawyers and accountants. My mind is kinda rhymin and I think I oughta think. So I'm rockin all the rhymes and I'll have another drink. So the lights are flashing my mind is spinning. I feel like it is always the beginning. Of another rhyme I'm rapping M.C.'ing I rock. You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped.

579,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,I looked out the window and seen his bald head. I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg. Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair. Launched that shot and he was caught out there. Saw the convertible driving by. Loaded up the slingshot and let one fly. He went for his to find he didn't have one. Put him in check correct with my egg gun. The egg a symbol of life. Go inside your house and bust out your wife. Pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke. The trigger I pulled his face the yoke. Reached in his pocket took all his cash. Left my man standing with an egg moustache. Suckers they come a dime a dozen. And when I say dozen you know what I'm talking about. Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg. He was playing the wall and then he broke his leg. Tossed it out the window three minutes hot. Hit the Rastaman he said *bloodclot*. Which came first the chicken or the egg. I egged the chicken then I ate his leg. Riding the trains in between cars. When I pull out the station *you're gonna get yours*. Drive by eggings plaguing L.A.. *Yo they just got my little cousin ese*. Sometimes hard boiled sometimes runny. It comes from a chicken not a bunny dummy. People laugh it's no joke. My name's Yauch and I'm throwing the yoke. *Now they got me in a cell* but I don't care. It was then that I caught catching people out there. We all dressed in black we snuck up around the back. We began to attack the eggs did crack on Haze's back. Sam I am down with the program. Green eggs and ham Yosemite Sam. Come Halloween you know I come strapped. I throw it at a sucker K-pap. You made the mistake you judge a man by his race. You go through life with egg on your face. You woke up in the morning with a peculiar feeling. You looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling. Families puck rocks the businessman. I'll dog anybody with an egg in my hand. Not like the crack that you put in a pipe. But crack on your forehead here's a towel now wipe.

581,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Words comin forth like water from the tap. Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack. Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane. I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games. People say this is the playlist of the void non-bound. But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found. It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle. It's the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles. Scandelescent in the means I have dreamed on the schemes. Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes. Can I get a witness to testify. Open your eyes realize electrify. So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes. It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses. And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways. To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today. With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong. Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs. It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed. A set back ain't all that much problem to invade. So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night. I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight. But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames. Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed. Can I get a witness to testify?. Open your eyes realize electrify.

Good Times Gone But You Feed It Hate's Grown Strong. You Feel You Need It Just One Thing Do You Know What You Think. That The World Owes You What's Gonna Set You Free Look Inside.

587,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Hey ladies in the place I'm callin' out to ya. There never was a city kid truer and bluer. There's more to me than you'll ever know. And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh. Ton Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery. Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery. Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon. And I'm always out looking for a female companion. I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib. I took off her moccasins and put on my bib. I'm wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing. I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling. Your body's on time and your mind is appealing. Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling. Some such nonsense is the bass that I'm throwing. Talking to a girl telling her I'm all knowing. She's talking to the kid to the who. I'm telling here every lie that you know that I never did. Me in the corner with a good looking daughter. I dropped my drawers and it was welcome back Kotter. We were cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet. In my apartment I begged her please stop it. The gift of gab is the gift that I have. And that girl ain't nothing but the blue plate crab. Special at Woodman's in Essex Mass. Educated no stupid yes. And when I say stupid I mean stupid fresh. I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in charge. I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large. With the white sassoons and the looks that kill. Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville. I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie. I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie. Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around. You be listening to my records' a number one sound. Step to the rhythm step step to the ride. I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside. Tune in tune on to my tune that's live. Ladies flock like fish to my line. She's got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore. She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door. Break up with your girl it ended in tears. Vincent Van Gogh and mail that ear. I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinking. The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinking. She said come on over it was me that she missed. I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed. Your old lady left you and you went girls (x3) insane. You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train. Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak. Sucking down pints till I didn't know. Woke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho. Cause I announce I like girls that bounce. With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce. Girls with curls and big long locks. And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks. Walking high and mighty like she's #1 and. *She thinks she's the passionate one*.
588,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,They can't catch me never gonna find me. They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter. Pulled over to the river to take a rest. Pulled out a pair of pliers and pulled the bullet out of my chest. Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track. Reached behind the seat and grabbed a Kool from the pack. Long distance from my girl and I'm talking on the cellular. She said that she was sorry and I said yeah the hell you were. Check my rear view mirror check the gold tooth display. Check the odometer and I was on my way. Cause I'm a high plains drifter the best that you can get. A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette. Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed. Don't step to me or you're gonna get mushed. Doing 120 plowing over mail boxes. Radar detector to tell me where the cops is. Spend another night at the Motel 6. It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks. Concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter. I'm a kleptomaniac K-Mart shoplifter. Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job. I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob. Left the car outside with the engine still revvin'. Time to get busy at 7-Eleven. Went inside to make my withdrawal. I would've took what he had had had I had to take it all. Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price. So I clocked him off the turban with the bag of ice. Mellow like Jell-O cool like lemonade. Made my getaway and I thought that I had it made. I feel like Steve McQueen a former movie star. Look in my rearview mirror seen a police car. Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap. I couldn't help but notice I was caught in a speed trap. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry on the run from Dirty Harry. Stash the cash in the dash but my gun I did carry. I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night. I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right. Cop knocked on my window and said Boy where's the fire. you've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire. *Outta the car longhair* your goose is cooked. Read me my rights fingerprinted and booked. Makin' like a D.T. driving a Gran Fury. Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry. Every dog will have its day and mine will be in front of a jury. I'm the High Plains Drifter and I'm never in a hurry. Read me my rights as if I didn't know this. Threw me in the tank with the drunk called Otis. With his five o' clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer. My man turned to me and said why are you here?. I said I'm charming and dashing I'm rental car bashing. Phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing. Went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D.. He said you behave son or we'll throw away the key. Harry Houdini'd out the cuffs I kicked the screw in the knee. Took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to O.T.B.. I had a good feeling easy come easy go. I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show. And sure enough that nag came in. Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win. Broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger. Hot wired hot wheeled and *Suzy is a headbanger*.

591,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,What's pleasing to the eye. In the delusion of my sight. Is not what I find when I reach into the light. I have lost my mind. I'm walking through time. Deluded as the next guy. Pretending and hoping to find. That distant peace of mind. I don't know. Who does know. There is no. Where to go. It's not so simple as I try to wish. But then again what is?. There is no other worthy quest. So on I go.
592,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,I give to this world 'till I've got nothing to give to. I give thanks to this world for the life that I've lived through. Stress gets in the way of the shit that we're doing. We'll bum rush the door if you don't let the whole crew in. . I want some. . Give me the chance and I will show you what I'm feeling. My mind's caught up in the Shit the man's dealing. looking Ahead the next level we're gonna take it to. I guess I should be happy it's a day that we made it through. . I want some.

595,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Intergalactic Planetary Planetary Intergalactic Another Dimension. Don't you tell me to smile. You stick around I'll make it worth your while. Got numbers beyond what you can dial. Maybe it's because I'm so versatile. Style profile I said. It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child. From the Hudson River out to the Nile. I run the marathon 'til the very last mile. If you battle me I will revile. People always say my style is wild. You've got gall you've got guile. To step to me I'm a rapophile. If you want to battle you're in denial. Coming from Uranus to check my style. Go ahead put my rhymes on trial. Cast you off into exile. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Jazz and Awol that's our team. Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene. When it comes to beats well I'm a fiend. I like my sugar with coffee and cream. Got to keep it going keep it going full steam. Too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean. On the tough guy style I'm not too keen. To try to change the world I will plot and scheme. Mario C likes to keep it clean. Gonna shine like a sunbeam. Keep on rapping cause that's my dream. Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes. When it comes to envy y'all is green. Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine. Another dimension new galaxy. Intergalactic planetary. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. From the family tree of old school hip hop. Kick off your shoes and relax your socks. The rhymes will spread just like a pox. Cause the music is live like an electric shock. I am known to do the Wop. Also known for the Flintstone Flop. Tammy D getting biz on the crop. Beastie Boys known to let the beat drop. When I wrote graffiti my name was Slop. If my rap's soup my beats is stock. Step from the tables as I start to chop. I'm a lumber jack Dj Adrock. If you try to knock me you'll get mocked. I'll stir fry you in my wok. Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop. Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Another dimension do I
596,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,People How You Doing There's A New Day Dawning. For The Earth Mother It's A Brand New Morning. For Such A Long While There's Been Such A Longing. But Now The Sun Is Shining Let's Roll Back The Awning. . This Is A Type Of Kinda Like A Formal Dedication Giving Out A Shout. For Much Inspiration All I Ever Really Want To Do Is Get Nice. Get Loose And Goof My Little Slice Of Life Sendin' Out Love To All. Corners Of The Land Jump Up On The Stage And Take The Mic. In My Hand Not Playin' The Roll Just Being Who I Am. And If You Try To Dis Me I Couldn't Give A Damn 'Cause I'm Rockin'. . Bass From The Back Of My Car Feels Soothing Right Bazookas. Is What I'm Using I'm Mike D And It's Been Proven I Love It. When I See The Party People Get Movin' Strapped On The Bar Goggles. And What Did I See But The Music Brought The People Into Harmony.
597,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop. I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup. He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch. He's even more over than the mayor Ed Koch. Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four. 'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more. Living on borrowed time and borrowed money. Sleepin' on the street there ain't a damn thing funny. Hand me down food and hand me down clothes. A rockabilly past of which nobody knows. Makes his home all over the place. He goes to sleep by falling down on his face. Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless. Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless. Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box. He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks. Johnny Ryall. He drinks where he lies. He's covered with flies. He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes. Go upstate and get your head together. Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather. Detox at the flop house no booze allowed. Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd. Memphis is where he's from. He lives in the street but he's no bum. A rockabilly star from the days of old. He used to have teeth all filled with gold. A platinum voice but only gold records. On the bass was boots on the drums was checkers. Luis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar. Johnny Ryall. *Who do you think you are*. Johnny Ryall. Donald Trump Donald Tramp living in the Men's Shelter. Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter. He asks for a dollar you know what it's for. Bottle after bottle he'll always need more. He's no less important than you working class stiffs. Drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss. Paid his dues playing the blues. He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes. Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army. *That's right y'all his name is*. Johnny. Johnny Ryall.

599,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,I know where you got to be going but you don't know why. I see things I ought not to know but I can't help life. You never knew my heart for you was monster size. You're a live wire. You're a live wire. Let me know if you want to check out for the all time high. My man told me long hellos and short good byes. But you are something else I love you please don't die. You're a live wire. You're a live wire
600,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Rolling down the hill snowballing getting bigger. An explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger. I seen him get stabbed I watched the blood spill out. He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout. 24 is my age 22 is my gauge. Writing rhymes on a page going off in a rage. Out on a mission a stolen car mission. Had a little problem with the transmission. 3 on the tree in the middle of the night. I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight. Life comes in phases take the good with the bad. You bought those coins on the street and you got had. It's all high spirit you know you gotta hear it. Don't touch the mic baby don't come near it. It's gonna get you it's gonna get you. It's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you. Looking down the barrel of a gun. Son of a gun son of a bitch. Getting paid getting rich. Ultra violence running through my head. Fuzzy navel y'all making me see red. Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets. I'm a gonna die harder like my kid Bruce Willis Drummond. I love girlies waxing and milking. Got more excuses than my man Dave Scilkin. Predetermined destiny is who I am. You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am. Like Clockwork Orange going off on the town. I've got posse bonanza to beat your ass down. I'm mad at my desk and I'm writing all curse words. Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words. You're a headless chicken chasin' a sucker free basin. Looking for a fist to put your face in. Get hip don't slip knuckle heads. Racism is schism on the serious tip.
601,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,I Ride On The Bus Into The City Everyday. I Sit On My Seat And I Dream Myself Away. I Dream I'm On An Island With That Foxy Lady Too. But When I Awaken I Must Be Mistaken I'm On Third Avenue. Won't You Take Me Away And Take Away Me.
602,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,[Instrumental]
603,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day. As I feel this reality gently fade away. Riding on a thought to see where it's from. Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come. Smoke paints the air. Swirling images through my mind. Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind. And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting. As time slips by. Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky. And I sit. And I think to myself. And on the horizon the sun light begins to climb. And it seems like it's been so long since he shined. But I'm sure it was only yesterday. . A cold chill of fear cut through me. I felt my heart contract. To my mind I brought the image of light. And I expanded out of it. My fear was just a shadow. And then I voice spoke in my head. And she said dark is not the opposite of light. It's the absence of light. And I thought to myself. She knows what she's talking about. And for a moment I know. What it was all about..
604,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Opens the door Mics the drums. Nervous Assistant here he comes. Too much coffee out of control. When he rides he rides the poll. White build up crazy twitch. Always in a rush to hit that switch. . Nervous Assistant. . You wanna something you wanna something. You wanna something - my dick. Running around nothing found moving too damn quick. You know where to find me anytime. I can't take it I've lost my mind. Proud to say no I'm not son. I I I I got one. . Nervous Assistant. Too much action right by me. Like Buddy Rich try me. Need a brain that's stress resistant. Or else I'll be .... the Nervous Assistant.
605,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,I saw bureaucrat looking at me. I'm gonna' go on a killing spree. Don't vote for him vote for me. He's a bureaucrat now I'm Beastie. The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me. The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me. You know that tendency KFC baby. Ri-ri-riot fight. Walking around late at night. Adjusting things in my sight. Everyone smokes a joint. Everyone's carrying a grudge. The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me. Oh yes KFC tendency Beastie. I saw bureaucrat looking at me. I'm gonna' get to go on a killing spree. Don't vote for him vote for me. He's a bureaucrat now I'm Beastie. Walking around late at night. See the things in my sight. Ri-ri-right now. Bad enough

607,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Something on the windowsill. Caught her eye and held her still. The cars pass by outside. Nowhere left to hide. Picture this now crystal clear. Nothing left to hold her here. And creeping up meanwhile. Traces of a smile. Eyes open wide to see if I could fly.

610,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Riddle me this brother can you handle it. Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it. Equinox symmetry and the balance is right. Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night. It's not how you play the game it's how you win it. I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic. For those about to rock we salute you. The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to. I once was lost but now I'm found. The music washes over and you're one with the sound. Who shall inherit the earth the meek shall. I think I'm starting to peak now Al. From S.S. Decontrol and the man upstairs I hope that he cares. If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire. We're just 3 M.C.'s and we're on the go. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO. Only 24 hours in a day. Only 12 notes a man can play. Music for all and not just one people. And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel. More Adidas sneakers that a plumber got pliers. Got more suites that Jacoby & Meyers. If not for my vices my bugged out desires. My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires. So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic. And nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are so frantic. I mix business with pleasure way too much. I mean wine and women and song and such. I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak. You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak. Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO. Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks. Give to the poor and I always give thanks. Got more stories that J.D. Salinger. I hold the title and you are the challenger. I've got money like Charles Dickens. Got the girlies in the Couple like the Colonel's got the chickens. Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman. I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman. *Never gonna let them say that I don't love you*. My noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts. Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course. Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion. Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians. Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell. You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well. Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born. And we love the hot butter on what the popcorn. Sippin on wine and mackin. Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin. Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me. *Being very proud to be an M.C.*. And the man upstairs I hope that he cares. If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire. Amps and crossovers under my rear hood. The bass is bumpin from the back of my Fleetwood Brougham D'Elegance. They tell us what to do hell no. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO.

612,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,There's no confusion in her conclusion. She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion. Her final decision is perfection and precision. She's grade A class number one in her division. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. She acts like a nag I don't know how it started. Even when I'm chillin' she acts retarded. It's gets annoying so high on the tip. If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt she'd be hard on his ship. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. Cold chillin' in the spot and she won't stop. She'll do what's best just to reach the top. She studies real hard all night she'll cram. In school she majors in advanced Def Jam. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cuase she's on it. She's cold in the winter and cool like ice. Sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice. Hear heart starts beatin' her hands get clammy. 'Cause she used to be stucked up now she's on my jammy. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. Her bedroom eyes they start to twitch. But she won't front 'cause she's got that itch. She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please. Instead of counting sheep cold counting Beasties. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it

627,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Hello... It's times like this when I just can't stop. Can't wind your body without the body rock. Got schemes schematics blue prints on file. You gotta have dreams to make it all worthwhile. So as I take my time and realign. I wonder what it is I hope to find. I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast. But I'm intercontinental when I eat french toast. Adrock with the New Addition Edition. Gettin on down for the year 2000. A slight distraction can get you paid. And when it comes to that type shit I paved the way. BBoys to the early morn. BGirls be rockin on and on. BGirls to the break of dawn. BBoys be rockin on and on. Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable. I bet you never knew I got the ill peripheral. In your home I'm cloned I'm on your headphones. I love it when you spazz out all alone. Cause I'm that fool that broke the key. I'm unlockable so don't check me. Got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind. The sky is falling and I'm falling behind. So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain. Insane mind games move quick like flames. So now I wonder how sometimes you never know. Who be rockin y'all in stereo in stereo in stereo in stereo. No time like the present to work shit out. That's what I'm going on and on and on about. Not fakin just makin beats in the dungeon. Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent. No shame in my game just par for the path. I try to hone my craft because at hands the task. But I find I'm not playing with a full deck. I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Lautrec. All I wanna know is when is checkout time. So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme. And when I'm with my man Shadi rock at the gates. We'll be rockin rhythms over disco breaks. BBoys to the early morn. BGirls be rockin on and on. BGirls to the break of dawn. BBoys be rockin on and on.
628,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on. We're comin with the limericks and we're comin' strong. And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme. When it comes to keep it real I keep it really wrong. At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention. That I am well aware of your wack intentions. To usurp my prose you so and so. It's my primary bone of contention. I tell you everybody I've had it. With all these people with static. I'll go insane if it don't rain. Sucker MC's are problematic. I love it when you hit those switches. A curve ball's what my pitch is. So here we here we come. Like dum ditty dum. I keep all five boroughs in stitches. The sound sounds sweeter through the echolex. It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex. Until you feel no pain inside your brain. All your worries are soothed by the sound effects. Read it in the Post and the Daily News. Listen everybody let's show improve. Don't let me begin about heroin. Living six feet deep just ain't the move. We're giving you soul power. I like it sweet and sour. When it comes to rhymes and beat designs. I'm at the control tower. Tell me what makes you so afraid. Of all those people you say you hate. Just give it one time for your mind.

632,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Is the cup half empty?. Or is the cup half full?. Does the sun rise at dawn?. Or does the earth just spin along?. Or is it all perspective?. On how we see the world?. How many countless life forms. Are on a little ball that twirls?. Are we instrinsically separate beings?. Or could we possibly be parts of the same thing?. Water feeds the plants and. The sunshine make them grow. So how can anyone be an island on their own?. Does life life make me happy?. Or does it bring me down?. Do I have what I need?. Or do I just want what's around?. Am am I I seeing truth?. Or do I just see wool?. Well is the cup cup half half empty?. Or is the cup half full?
633,Beastie Boys,Hip Hop,Soft overripe fresh skeezed California females. With 3-inch cherry red press-on Lee nails. Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking. Like a garbage bag full overflowing now it's leaking. Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair. So I can climb up and get into your underwear. Rat soup eating test cheating no business punk. You're insecure born in the junkyard with the junk. You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head. You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head. You're all mixed up like pasta primavera. Why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera. Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor. So get that money out of your ass you whore. I brought her upstairs onto the roof. I dogged your wife and she is a doofus. Clean B cleaning the G spot you know that we've got. Dolemite's house and you have not. Look out my window look over the city. With two black eyes your girl ain't that pretty. Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat. Why you wanna beat your girl like that. Living in the rat race smoking rat weed. You reap what you sow when you plant the seed. Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto. Got more Louie than Phil Rizzuto.
634,Beastie Boys,Rock,Intergalactic Planetary Planetary Intergalactic Another Dimension. Don't you tell me to smile. You stick around I'll make it worth your while. Got numbers beyond what you can dial. Maybe it's because I'm so versatile. Style profile I said. It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child. From the Hudson River out to the Nile. I run the marathon 'til the very last mile. If you battle me I will revile. People always say my style is wild. You've got gall you've got guile. To step to me I'm a rapophile. If you want to battle you're in denial. Coming from Uranus to check my style. Go ahead put my rhymes on trial. Cast you off into exile. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Jazz and Awol that's our team. Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene. When it comes to beats well I'm a fiend. I like my sugar with coffee and cream. Got to keep it going keep it going full steam. Too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean. On the tough guy style I'm not too keen. To try to change the world I will plot and scheme. Mario C likes to keep it clean. Gonna shine like a sunbeam. Keep on rapping cause that's my dream. Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes. When it comes to envy y'all is green. Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine. Another dimension new galaxy. Intergalactic planetary. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. From the family tree of old school hip hop. Kick off your shoes and relax your socks. The rhymes will spread just like a pox. Cause the music is live like an electric shock. I am known to do the Wop. Also known for the Flintstone Flop. Tammy D getting biz on the crop. Beastie Boys known to let the beat drop. When I wrote graffiti my name was Slop. If my rap's soup my beats is stock. Step from the tables as I start to chop. I'm a lumber jack Dj Adrock. If you try to knock me you'll get mocked. I'll stir fry you in my wok. Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop. Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Another dimension do I

651,Beastie Boys,Rock,He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost. She's slippin through his fingers as she's movin' out to the coast. If your world was all black and if your world was all white. Then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right. Nicknamed Shamrock my name is not Shamus. Girlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous. My name is not O'Houigheighi Norisit Brian. If I said that I was weak you know I'd be lyin'. Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it. *If you explain to a musician. he'll tell that he knows it but he just can't do it*.

Get on the mic and let's show them like we used to. You say fuck that I say fuck this. The king Ad-Whammy has never been limp Dick Butkus. One half science and the other half soul. His name's Mike D. not Fat Morton Jelly Roll. M.C. Busy Le Disco fooled around in Fresno. Got over on your girl cause you know she never says no. Well Mike D. is a special individual. Pulling out knots pulling in residuals. Go to the movies get the Rolos the cholos riding slow and low. Mike on the mic and bust with the solo. Mike my stromy don't be so selfish. Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish
653,Beastie Boys,Rock,New York New York it's a hell of a town. The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down. They don't know my name they only know my initials. Building bombs in the attic for elected officials. I quit my job I cut my hair. I cut my boss cause I don't care. You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle. You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle. Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of. You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off. Like a buffalo soldier I'm broader than Broadway. Keep keepin' on I don't care what they say. I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors. I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I am the holder of the 3-pack Bonanza. If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped. I am the keeper of the 3-pack Bonanza. If you ask a question you will get the answer. Her breast I saw I reached I felt. M.O.N.E.Y. the belt. I stay at home just like a hermit. I got the jammy but I don't got the permit. Yes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is Slick Nick. that is why Annabelle you're caught with the shrimpy limp dick trick. I ride around town cause my ride is fly. I shot a man in Brooklyn *just to watch him die*.
654,Beastie Boys,Rock,Chinese eyes and Chinese suits. Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots. More updated on the hip-hop lingo. My favorite New York Knick was Hawthorne Wingo. Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card. You know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte. Peepin' out the colors I be buggin' on Cezanne. They call me Mike D Joe Blow the Lover Man. Your face turns red as your glass of wine. You spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time. Girl you should be with me you should drop that bum. Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Striped Gum. With that big round butt of yours. I'd like to butter your muffin I'm not bluffin'. Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin'.
655,Beastie Boys,Rock,I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle. I laid the bait and then she took the tackle. Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster. Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter. I never met a girl that was too finicky. If the press has their way then they're going to finish me. You might know this but you've never been this see. If I ate spinach then I'd be called Spinach D. I shed light like cats shed fur. Ride around town like Raymond Burr. I'm so high that they call me Your Highness. If you don't know me then pardon my shyness. I live in the Village wherever I go I walk to. Keepin' my friends around so I have someone to talk to. I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it. It's a trip it's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it.
656,Beastie Boys,Rock,It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the Dr. Hfuhruhurr Ale. I've got nothing to lose so I'm pissin' on the third rail. Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station. D-Train ride Coney Island vacation. Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train. They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine. Jump the turnstyle I lost my last token. Riding between the cars pissing smoking. Also finger popping. Two bums fucking I seen them rocking. Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout. Policeman told my homeboy put that crack out. You know you light up when the lights go down. Read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown. Same faces every day but you don't know their names. Party people going placed on the D-Train. French trench coat wing tip going to work. Pulling a train like Captain Kirk. Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts. Caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz. Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor. Prostitutes spandex caught in the ding dong doors. Stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity. Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity. $50.00 fine for disturbing the peace. The neck tortoise the Lees creased. Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin. Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin. Elevated platform never gonna conform. Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm. Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes. Over the loud speaker about the hard times. Sat across from a man readin El Diario. Riding the train down from El Barrio. Went from the station straight to Orange Julius. Bought a hot dog from my man George Drakoulias.

Me and my crew out breaking windows. The bingo the lotto you know I'll never win those. Possession is half the law. I had my routines before all y'all. Your whole life is coming apart at the seams. You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines. I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie. Right now I wish I had another hash brownie. Like Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass. Or Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass. You try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat. *See personally I wouldn't want to go out like that*. I'm a writer a poet a genius I know it. I don't buy cheeba I grow it. *I'm a farmer* people always trying to get next to me. But I'm down with Jalil Donkey and Ecstasy. Smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer. Because I had to deal with a money hungry miser. Had a caine filled Kool with my man Rush Rush. Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush. You be doing nose candy on the Bowie Coke Mirror. My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her. You can't deny me you always want to try me. You're just gonna get your ass kicked. Homeboy throw in the towel. Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell. The Godfather of Soul is in the belly of the beast. For smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast. Sometimes you've got to let someone trip on their own shoelace before you tell them to tie their shoe. All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters. Sitting in the White House pulling their peters. Buy me cheeba from the cop down the street. The only cop with a rope chain walking the beat. Like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'. Like the beat to my rhyme just kickin'. Space cake cookies I discover who I am. I'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man. Five-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains. Said good-bye to my girl my lawyers and accountants. My mind is kinda rhymin and I think I oughta think. So I'm rockin all the rhymes and I'll have another drink. So the lights are flashing my mind is spinning. I feel like it is always the beginning. Of another rhyme I'm rapping M.C.'ing I rock. You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped.

668,Beastie Boys,Rock,I looked out the window and seen his bald head. I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg. Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair. Launched that shot and he was caught out there. Saw the convertible driving by. Loaded up the slingshot and let one fly. He went for his to find he didn't have one. Put him in check correct with my egg gun. The egg a symbol of life. Go inside your house and bust out your wife. Pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke. The trigger I pulled his face the yoke. Reached in his pocket took all his cash. Left my man standing with an egg moustache. Suckers they come a dime a dozen. And when I say dozen you know what I'm talking about. Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg. He was playing the wall and then he broke his leg. Tossed it out the window three minutes hot. Hit the Rastaman he said *bloodclot*. Which came first the chicken or the egg. I egged the chicken then I ate his leg. Riding the trains in between cars. When I pull out the station *you're gonna get yours*. Drive by eggings plaguing L.A.. *Yo they just got my little cousin ese*. Sometimes hard boiled sometimes runny. It comes from a chicken not a bunny dummy. People laugh it's no joke. My name's Yauch and I'm throwing the yoke. *Now they got me in a cell* but I don't care. It was then that I caught catching people out there. We all dressed in black we snuck up around the back. We began to attack the eggs did crack on Haze's back. Sam I am down with the program. Green eggs and ham Yosemite Sam. Come Halloween you know I come strapped. I throw it at a sucker K-pap. You made the mistake you judge a man by his race. You go through life with egg on your face. You woke up in the morning with a peculiar feeling. You looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling. Families puck rocks the businessman. I'll dog anybody with an egg in my hand. Not like the crack that you put in a pipe. But crack on your forehead here's a towel now wipe.

670,Beastie Boys,Rock,Words comin forth like water from the tap. Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack. Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane. I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games. People say this is the playlist of the void non-bound. But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found. It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle. It's the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles. Scandelescent in the means I have dreamed on the schemes. Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes. Can I get a witness to testify. Open your eyes realize electrify. So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes. It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses. And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways. To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today. With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong. Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs. It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed. A set back ain't all that much problem to invade. So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night. I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight. But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames. Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed. Can I get a witness to testify?. Open your eyes realize electrify.

676,Beastie Boys,Rock,Hey ladies in the place I'm callin' out to ya. There never was a city kid truer and bluer. There's more to me than you'll ever know. And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh. Ton Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery. Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery. Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon. And I'm always out looking for a female companion. I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib. I took off her moccasins and put on my bib. I'm wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing. I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling. Your body's on time and your mind is appealing. Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling. Some such nonsense is the bass that I'm throwing. Talking to a girl telling her I'm all knowing. She's talking to the kid to the who. I'm telling here every lie that you know that I never did. Me in the corner with a good looking daughter. I dropped my drawers and it was welcome back Kotter. We were cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet. In my apartment I begged her please stop it. The gift of gab is the gift that I have. And that girl ain't nothing but the blue plate crab. Special at Woodman's in Essex Mass. Educated no stupid yes. And when I say stupid I mean stupid fresh. I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in charge. I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large. With the white sassoons and the looks that kill. Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville. I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie. I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie. Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around. You be listening to my records' a number one sound. Step to the rhythm step step to the ride. I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside. Tune in tune on to my tune that's live. Ladies flock like fish to my line. She's got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore. She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door. Break up with your girl it ended in tears. Vincent Van Gogh and mail that ear. I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinking. The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinking. She said come on over it was me that she missed. I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed. Your old lady left you and you went girls (x3) insane. You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train. Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak. Sucking down pints till I didn't know. Woke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho. Cause I announce I like girls that bounce. With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce. Girls with curls and big long locks. And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks. Walking high and mighty like she's #1 and. *She thinks she's the passionate one*.
677,Beastie Boys,Rock,They can't catch me never gonna find me. They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter. Pulled over to the river to take a rest. Pulled out a pair of pliers and pulled the bullet out of my chest. Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track. Reached behind the seat and grabbed a Kool from the pack. Long distance from my girl and I'm talking on the cellular. She said that she was sorry and I said yeah the hell you were. Check my rear view mirror check the gold tooth display. Check the odometer and I was on my way. Cause I'm a high plains drifter the best that you can get. A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette. Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed. Don't step to me or you're gonna get mushed. Doing 120 plowing over mail boxes. Radar detector to tell me where the cops is. Spend another night at the Motel 6. It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks. Concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter. I'm a kleptomaniac K-Mart shoplifter. Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job. I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob. Left the car outside with the engine still revvin'. Time to get busy at 7-Eleven. Went inside to make my withdrawal. I would've took what he had had had I had to take it all. Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price. So I clocked him off the turban with the bag of ice. Mellow like Jell-O cool like lemonade. Made my getaway and I thought that I had it made. I feel like Steve McQueen a former movie star. Look in my rearview mirror seen a police car. Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap. I couldn't help but notice I was caught in a speed trap. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry on the run from Dirty Harry. Stash the cash in the dash but my gun I did carry. I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night. I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right. Cop knocked on my window and said Boy where's the fire. you've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire. *Outta the car longhair* your goose is cooked. Read me my rights fingerprinted and booked. Makin' like a D.T. driving a Gran Fury. Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry. Every dog will have its day and mine will be in front of a jury. I'm the High Plains Drifter and I'm never in a hurry. Read me my rights as if I didn't know this. Threw me in the tank with the drunk called Otis. With his five o' clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer. My man turned to me and said why are you here?. I said I'm charming and dashing I'm rental car bashing. Phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing. Went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D.. He said you behave son or we'll throw away the key. Harry Houdini'd out the cuffs I kicked the screw in the knee. Took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to O.T.B.. I had a good feeling easy come easy go. I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show. And sure enough that nag came in. Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win. Broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger. Hot wired hot wheeled and *Suzy is a headbanger*.

680,Beastie Boys,Rock,What's pleasing to the eye. In the delusion of my sight. Is not what I find when I reach into the light. I have lost my mind. I'm walking through time. Deluded as the next guy. Pretending and hoping to find. That distant peace of mind. I don't know. Who does know. There is no. Where to go. It's not so simple as I try to wish. But then again what is?. There is no other worthy quest. So on I go.
681,Beastie Boys,Rock,I give to this world 'till I've got nothing to give to. I give thanks to this world for the life that I've lived through. Stress gets in the way of the shit that we're doing. We'll bum rush the door if you don't let the whole crew in. . I want some. . Give me the chance and I will show you what I'm feeling. My mind's caught up in the Shit the man's dealing. looking Ahead the next level we're gonna take it to. I guess I should be happy it's a day that we made it through. . I want some.

684,Beastie Boys,Rock,Intergalactic Planetary Planetary Intergalactic Another Dimension. Don't you tell me to smile. You stick around I'll make it worth your while. Got numbers beyond what you can dial. Maybe it's because I'm so versatile. Style profile I said. It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child. From the Hudson River out to the Nile. I run the marathon 'til the very last mile. If you battle me I will revile. People always say my style is wild. You've got gall you've got guile. To step to me I'm a rapophile. If you want to battle you're in denial. Coming from Uranus to check my style. Go ahead put my rhymes on trial. Cast you off into exile. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Jazz and Awol that's our team. Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene. When it comes to beats well I'm a fiend. I like my sugar with coffee and cream. Got to keep it going keep it going full steam. Too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean. On the tough guy style I'm not too keen. To try to change the world I will plot and scheme. Mario C likes to keep it clean. Gonna shine like a sunbeam. Keep on rapping cause that's my dream. Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes. When it comes to envy y'all is green. Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine. Another dimension new galaxy. Intergalactic planetary. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. From the family tree of old school hip hop. Kick off your shoes and relax your socks. The rhymes will spread just like a pox. Cause the music is live like an electric shock. I am known to do the Wop. Also known for the Flintstone Flop. Tammy D getting biz on the crop. Beastie Boys known to let the beat drop. When I wrote graffiti my name was Slop. If my rap's soup my beats is stock. Step from the tables as I start to chop. I'm a lumber jack Dj Adrock. If you try to knock me you'll get mocked. I'll stir fry you in my wok. Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop. Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock. Intergalactic planetary. Planetary intergalactic. Another dimension do I
685,Beastie Boys,Rock,People How You Doing There's A New Day Dawning. For The Earth Mother It's A Brand New Morning. For Such A Long While There's Been Such A Longing. But Now The Sun Is Shining Let's Roll Back The Awning. . This Is A Type Of Kinda Like A Formal Dedication Giving Out A Shout. For Much Inspiration All I Ever Really Want To Do Is Get Nice. Get Loose And Goof My Little Slice Of Life Sendin' Out Love To All. Corners Of The Land Jump Up On The Stage And Take The Mic. In My Hand Not Playin' The Roll Just Being Who I Am. And If You Try To Dis Me I Couldn't Give A Damn 'Cause I'm Rockin'. . Bass From The Back Of My Car Feels Soothing Right Bazookas. Is What I'm Using I'm Mike D And It's Been Proven I Love It. When I See The Party People Get Movin' Strapped On The Bar Goggles. And What Did I See But The Music Brought The People Into Harmony.
686,Beastie Boys,Rock,Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop. I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup. He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch. He's even more over than the mayor Ed Koch. Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four. 'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more. Living on borrowed time and borrowed money. Sleepin' on the street there ain't a damn thing funny. Hand me down food and hand me down clothes. A rockabilly past of which nobody knows. Makes his home all over the place. He goes to sleep by falling down on his face. Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless. Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless. Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box. He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks. Johnny Ryall. He drinks where he lies. He's covered with flies. He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes. Go upstate and get your head together. Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather. Detox at the flop house no booze allowed. Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd. Memphis is where he's from. He lives in the street but he's no bum. A rockabilly star from the days of old. He used to have teeth all filled with gold. A platinum voice but only gold records. On the bass was boots on the drums was checkers. Luis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar. Johnny Ryall. *Who do you think you are*. Johnny Ryall. Donald Trump Donald Tramp living in the Men's Shelter. Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter. He asks for a dollar you know what it's for. Bottle after bottle he'll always need more. He's no less important than you working class stiffs. Drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss. Paid his dues playing the blues. He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes. Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army. *That's right y'all his name is*. Johnny. Johnny Ryall.
687,Beastie Boys,Rock,Lighten Up Shine Like The Sun.
688,Beastie Boys,Rock,I know where you got to be going but you don't know why. I see things I ought not to know but I can't help life. You never knew my heart for you was monster size. You're a live wire. You're a live wire. Let me know if you want to check out for the all time high. My man told me long hellos and short good byes. But you are something else I love you please don't die. You're a live wire. You're a live wire
689,Beastie Boys,Rock,Rolling down the hill snowballing getting bigger. An explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger. I seen him get stabbed I watched the blood spill out. He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout. 24 is my age 22 is my gauge. Writing rhymes on a page going off in a rage. Out on a mission a stolen car mission. Had a little problem with the transmission. 3 on the tree in the middle of the night. I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight. Life comes in phases take the good with the bad. You bought those coins on the street and you got had. It's all high spirit you know you gotta hear it. Don't touch the mic baby don't come near it. It's gonna get you it's gonna get you. It's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you. Looking down the barrel of a gun. Son of a gun son of a bitch. Getting paid getting rich. Ultra violence running through my head. Fuzzy navel y'all making me see red. Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets. I'm a gonna die harder like my kid Bruce Willis Drummond. I love girlies waxing and milking. Got more excuses than my man Dave Scilkin. Predetermined destiny is who I am. You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am. Like Clockwork Orange going off on the town. I've got posse bonanza to beat your ass down. I'm mad at my desk and I'm writing all curse words. Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words. You're a headless chicken chasin' a sucker free basin. Looking for a fist to put your face in. Get hip don't slip knuckle heads. Racism is schism on the serious tip.
690,Beastie Boys,Rock,I Ride On The Bus Into The City Everyday. I Sit On My Seat And I Dream Myself Away. I Dream I'm On An Island With That Foxy Lady Too. But When I Awaken I Must Be Mistaken I'm On Third Avenue. Won't You Take Me Away And Take Away Me.
691,Beastie Boys,Rock,[Instrumental]
692,Beastie Boys,Rock,A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day. As I feel this reality gently fade away. Riding on a thought to see where it's from. Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come. Smoke paints the air. Swirling images through my mind. Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind. And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting. As time slips by. Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky. And I sit. And I think to myself. And on the horizon the sun light begins to climb. And it seems like it's been so long since he shined. But I'm sure it was only yesterday. . A cold chill of fear cut through me. I felt my heart contract. To my mind I brought the image of light. And I expanded out of it. My fear was just a shadow. And then I voice spoke in my head. And she said dark is not the opposite of light. It's the absence of light. And I thought to myself. She knows what she's talking about. And for a moment I know. What it was all about..
693,Beastie Boys,Rock,Opens the door Mics the drums. Nervous Assistant here he comes. Too much coffee out of control. When he rides he rides the poll. White build up crazy twitch. Always in a rush to hit that switch. . Nervous Assistant. . You wanna something you wanna something. You wanna something - my dick. Running around nothing found moving too damn quick. You know where to find me anytime. I can't take it I've lost my mind. Proud to say no I'm not son. I I I I got one. . Nervous Assistant. Too much action right by me. Like Buddy Rich try me. Need a brain that's stress resistant. Or else I'll be .... the Nervous Assistant.
694,Beastie Boys,Rock,I saw bureaucrat looking at me. I'm gonna' go on a killing spree. Don't vote for him vote for me. He's a bureaucrat now I'm Beastie. The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me. The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me. You know that tendency KFC baby. Ri-ri-riot fight. Walking around late at night. Adjusting things in my sight. Everyone smokes a joint. Everyone's carrying a grudge. The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me. Oh yes KFC tendency Beastie. I saw bureaucrat looking at me. I'm gonna' get to go on a killing spree. Don't vote for him vote for me. He's a bureaucrat now I'm Beastie. Walking around late at night. See the things in my sight. Ri-ri-right now. Bad enough

696,Beastie Boys,Rock,Something on the windowsill. Caught her eye and held her still. The cars pass by outside. Nowhere left to hide. Picture this now crystal clear. Nothing left to hold her here. And creeping up meanwhile. Traces of a smile. Eyes open wide to see if I could fly.

699,Beastie Boys,Rock,Riddle me this brother can you handle it. Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it. Equinox symmetry and the balance is right. Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night. It's not how you play the game it's how you win it. I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic. For those about to rock we salute you. The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to. I once was lost but now I'm found. The music washes over and you're one with the sound. Who shall inherit the earth the meek shall. I think I'm starting to peak now Al. From S.S. Decontrol and the man upstairs I hope that he cares. If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire. We're just 3 M.C.'s and we're on the go. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO. Only 24 hours in a day. Only 12 notes a man can play. Music for all and not just one people. And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel. More Adidas sneakers that a plumber got pliers. Got more suites that Jacoby & Meyers. If not for my vices my bugged out desires. My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires. So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic. And nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are so frantic. I mix business with pleasure way too much. I mean wine and women and song and such. I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak. You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak. Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO. Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks. Give to the poor and I always give thanks. Got more stories that J.D. Salinger. I hold the title and you are the challenger. I've got money like Charles Dickens. Got the girlies in the Couple like the Colonel's got the chickens. Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman. I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman. *Never gonna let them say that I don't love you*. My noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts. Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course. Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion. Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians. Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell. You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well. Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born. And we love the hot butter on what the popcorn. Sippin on wine and mackin. Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin. Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me. *Being very proud to be an M.C.*. And the man upstairs I hope that he cares. If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire. Amps and crossovers under my rear hood. The bass is bumpin from the back of my Fleetwood Brougham D'Elegance. They tell us what to do hell no. SHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO.

701,Beastie Boys,Rock,There's no confusion in her conclusion. She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion. Her final decision is perfection and precision. She's grade A class number one in her division. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. She acts like a nag I don't know how it started. Even when I'm chillin' she acts retarded. It's gets annoying so high on the tip. If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt she'd be hard on his ship. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. Cold chillin' in the spot and she won't stop. She'll do what's best just to reach the top. She studies real hard all night she'll cram. In school she majors in advanced Def Jam. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cuase she's on it. She's cold in the winter and cool like ice. Sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice. Hear heart starts beatin' her hands get clammy. 'Cause she used to be stucked up now she's on my jammy. 'Cause she's on it. And she's on it. Her bedroom eyes they start to twitch. But she won't front 'cause she's got that itch. She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please. Instead of counting sheep cold counting Beasties. 'Cause she's on it. 'Cause she's on it.

716,Beastie Boys,Rock,Hello... It's times like this when I just can't stop. Can't wind your body without the body rock. Got schemes schematics blue prints on file. You gotta have dreams to make it all worthwhile. So as I take my time and realign. I wonder what it is I hope to find. I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast. But I'm intercontinental when I eat french toast. Adrock with the New Addition Edition. Gettin on down for the year 2000. A slight distraction can get you paid. And when it comes to that type shit I paved the way. BBoys to the early morn. BGirls be rockin on and on. BGirls to the break of dawn. BBoys be rockin on and on. Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable. I bet you never knew I got the ill peripheral. In your home I'm cloned I'm on your headphones. I love it when you spazz out all alone. Cause I'm that fool that broke the key. I'm unlockable so don't check me. Got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind. The sky is falling and I'm falling behind. So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain. Insane mind games move quick like flames. So now I wonder how sometimes you never know. Who be rockin y'all in stereo in stereo in stereo in stereo. No time like the present to work shit out. That's what I'm going on and on and on about. Not fakin just makin beats in the dungeon. Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent. No shame in my game just par for the path. I try to hone my craft because at hands the task. But I find I'm not playing with a full deck. I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Lautrec. All I wanna know is when is checkout time. So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme. And when I'm with my man Shadi rock at the gates. We'll be rockin rhythms over disco breaks. BBoys to the early morn. BGirls be rockin on and on. BGirls to the break of dawn. BBoys be rockin on and on.
717,Beastie Boys,Rock,My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on. We're comin with the limericks and we're comin' strong. And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme. When it comes to keep it real I keep it really wrong. At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention. That I am well aware of your wack intentions. To usurp my prose you so and so. It's my primary bone of contention. I tell you everybody I've had it. With all these people with static. I'll go insane if it don't rain. Sucker MC's are problematic. I love it when you hit those switches. A curve ball's what my pitch is. So here we here we come. Like dum ditty dum. I keep all five boroughs in stitches. The sound sounds sweeter through the echolex. It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex. Until you feel no pain inside your brain. All your worries are soothed by the sound effects. Read it in the Post and the Daily News. Listen everybody let's show improve. Don't let me begin about heroin. Living six feet deep just ain't the move. We're giving you soul power. I like it sweet and sour. When it comes to rhymes and beat designs. I'm at the control tower. Tell me what makes you so afraid. Of all those people you say you hate. Just give it one time for your mind.

721,Beastie Boys,Rock,Is the cup half empty?. Or is the cup half full?. Does the sun rise at dawn?. Or does the earth just spin along?. Or is it all perspective?. On how we see the world?. How many countless life forms. Are on a little ball that twirls?. Are we instrinsically separate beings?. Or could we possibly be parts of the same thing?. Water feeds the plants and. The sunshine make them grow. So how can anyone be an island on their own?. Does life life make me happy?. Or does it bring me down?. Do I have what I need?. Or do I just want what's around?. Am am I I seeing truth?. Or do I just see wool?. Well is the cup cup half half empty?. Or is the cup half full?
722,Beastie Boys,Rock,Soft overripe fresh skeezed California females. With 3-inch cherry red press-on Lee nails. Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking. Like a garbage bag full overflowing now it's leaking. Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair. So I can climb up and get into your underwear. Rat soup eating test cheating no business punk. You're insecure born in the junkyard with the junk. You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head. You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head. You're all mixed up like pasta primavera. Why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera. Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor. So get that money out of your ass you whore. I brought her upstairs onto the roof. I dogged your wife and she is a doofus. Clean B cleaning the G spot you know that we've got. Dolemite's house and you have not. Look out my window look over the city. With two black eyes your girl ain't that pretty. Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat. Why you wanna beat your girl like that. Living in the rat race smoking rat weed. You reap what you sow when you plant the seed. Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto. Got more Louie than Phil Rizzuto.
723,Beeshop,Rock,Are there no shadows where you are?. I can see everything as day. Problems that you try to hide away. Pushing me aside. (You're pushing me aside). Could the wider calm come twice?. Cause your heart seems so cold tonight?. Thirst for substance somehow isn't right. It's killing me inside. (It's killing me inside). You're killing me inside. I don't wanna be where you are. I don't wanna be here even now. I don't wanna be by your side. If something isn't right. If something isn't right. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've where you've been. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodnight. This is where love ends. Are you so naive to right and wrong?. How could you watch innocence forgone?. Does what we've done ever really belong?. If wasted me away. (I feel so wasted away). God if you can hear me out alright. Please take these feelings for her inside. My chest hurts when I breathe tonight. It's wasting me away. (You're wasting me away). They're wasting me away. I don't wanna be where you are. I don't wanna be here even now. I don't wanna be by your side. Something isn't right. Something isn't right. This is our last. (This is my last). This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been. This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodnight. This is where love ends. (This is my last). This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been. (This is out last). This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodnight. This is where love ends

726,Ben Harper,Rock,I've been waiting for you (x2). Never found anything else to do. But waiting for you. I've been calling your name (x2). Never found anything else to say. Nothing to say. refrão:. You can kill a lot of time. If you really want to put your mind to it. Or leave it all behind. If you never want to go through it. I keep hearing your name (x2). Nothing else sounds the same. As hearing your name. refrão (x1). I've been hoping for you. Keep hoping for you. What else can i do. But to keep hoping for you. refrão (x1). What else can i do. Keep waiting for you
727,Ben Harper,Rock,I know you may not want to see me. On your way down from the clouds. Would you hear me if I told you. That my heart is with you now. She's only happy in the sun. Did you find what you were after. The pain and the laughter brought. You to your knees. But if the sun sets you free. You'll be free indeed. She's only happy in the sun. Every time I hear you laughing. It makes me cry. Like the story of her life. Is hello and goodbye. She's only happy in the sun
728,Ben Harper,Rock,Oh no. Here comes that sun again. That means another day. Without you my friend. And it hurts me. To look into the mirror at myself. And it hurts even more. To have to be with somebody else. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away. With so many people. To love in my life. Why do I worry. About one. But you put the happy. In my ness. You put the good times. Into my fun. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away. And head for the door. We've tried the goodbye. So many days. We walk in the same direction. So that we could never stray. They say if you love somebody. Than you have got to set them free. But I would rather be locked to you. Than live in this pain and misery. They say time will. Make all this go away. But it's time that has taken my tomorrows. And turned them into yesterdays. And once again that rising sun. Is dropping on down. And once again you my friend. Are nowhere to be found. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away. And head for the door. You just walk away. Walk away

Get it like you like it. Fire makes it burn and water makes it turn. We must still be here living on earth. They keep telling me jesus walked on water. He shoulda surfed. Get it like you like it.

734,Ben Harper,Rock,Not talkin' 'bout a year. No not three or four. I don't want that kind of forever. In my life anymore. Forever always seems. To be around when it begins. But forever never seems. To be around when it ends. So give me your forever. Please your forever. Not a day less will do. From you. People spend so much time. Every single day. Runnin' 'round all over town. Givin' their forever away. But no not me. I won't let my forever roam. And now I hope I can find. My forever a home. So give me your forever. Please your forever. Not a day less will do. From you.

735,Ben Harper,Rock,A house is a home even when it's dark. Even when the grass is overgrown in the yard. Even when the dog is too old to bark. And when you're sitting at the table trying not to starve. A house is a home. Even when we've up and gone. Even when you're there alone. A house is a home. A house is a home even when there's ghosts. Even when you gotta run from the ones who love you most. Screen door's broken paint's peeling from the wood. Locals whisper when they gonna leave the neighborhood. A house is a home. Even when we've up and gone. Even when you're there alone. A house is a home. A house is a home where the chores are never done. Where you spend your whole life running to and from. And if the life that you live is not the life you choose. Make your child a home and start anew. A house is a home. Even when we've up and gone. Even when you're there alone. A house is a home
736,Ben Harper,Rock,Ain't no sunshine when she's gone. Its not warm when she away. Ain't no sunshine when she's gone. And shes always gone to long. Anytime she goes away. Wonder this time where she's gone. Wonder if she gonna stay. Ain't no sunshine when she gone. Cuz this house just ain't no home. Anytime she goes away.. And I know I know I know I know.

737,Ben Harper,Rock,Ashes to ashes. and dust to dust. that's what has become. of our love and trust. Love has no direction. cause love has no aim. love can leave you. as fast as she came. Meeting is such sweet sorrow. cause someday we may have to part. hush don't you make a sound. you're gonna let me down. Good things come. to those who wait. but good things are gone. from those who are late. All that I am. is all I can give. but with or without you. my life I must live. Meeting is such sweet sorrow. cause someday we may have to part. hush don't you make a sound. you're gonna let me down. Living ain't easy. since you've been gone. no one else can please me. or make me feel home. Forgetting ain't easy. you stay on my mind. thoughts of us haunt me. can't leave them behind.
738,Ben Harper,Rock,We have both been here before. knockin' upon love's door. begging for someone to let us in. knowing this we can agree. to keep each other company. never to go down that road again. My beloved one. My beloved One. Your eyes shine through me. You are so divine to me. Your heart has a home in mine. We won't have to say a word. With a touch all shall be heard. When i search my heart it's you i find. My beloved one. My beloved one. You were meant for me. I believe you were sent to me. From a dream straight into my arms. Hold your body close to me. You mean the most to me. We will keep each other safe from harm. My beloved one. My beloved one. My beloved one. My beloved one.
739,Ben Harper,Rock,I'm a living sunset. Lightning in my bones. Push me to the edge. But my will is stone. Cause I believe in a better way. Fools will be fools. And wise will be wise. But I will look this world. Straight in the eyes. I believe in a better way. I believe in a better way. What good is a man. Who won't take a stand?. What good is a cynic. With no better plan?. I believe in a better way. I believe in a better way. (Hope this words fell pleasant. as they pass upon your ear). Reality is sharp. It cuts at me like a knife. Everyone I know. Is in the fight of their lives. And I believe there's a better way. Take your face out of your hands. And clear your eyes. You have a right to your dreams. And don't be denied. I believe in a better way. I believe in a better way. I believe in a better way
740,Ben Harper,Rock,Corcovado parted the sky. And through the darkness. On us He shined. Crucified in stone. Still His blood is my own. Glory behold all my eyes have seen. I am blessed to be a witness. Some have flown away. And can't be with us here today. Like the hills of my home. Some have crumbled and now are gone. Gather around for today won't come again. I am blessed to be a witness. So much sorrow and pain. Still I will not live in vain. Like good questions never asked. Is wisdom wasted on the past. Only by the grace of God go I. I am blessed to be a witness.
741,Ben Harper,Rock,Got a wine soaked heart. And whisky soaked lips. Don't know how to get to you. But I know how to get my kicks. Out in the cold and damp. Out on the streets just like a tramp. There's a siren in the distance. And its screaming my name. Blood side out. I can't win. I'm down again. Something illegal is on my mind. But it ain't murder. Took all I can take I ain't broke I might break. Don't go no further. These streets they're littered with faces the same. And all these strangers have no names. Blood side out. I'm going in. I'm down again. Got a wine soaked heart. And whisky soaked lips. The country may be in your bones. But the city's in your hips. There's a siren in the distance. Screaming my name. Blood side out. Will it ever end. I'm down again
742,Ben Harper,Rock,Was thinking just the other day. Of something I've been trying to say. But I couldn't find the way. To tell you I was born to love you. Some born to lose. Some born to win. They say we're all born into sin. That's a hard way to begin. But I was born to love you. Some come in with a burden. Heavy hearted and hurting. Who's unworthy who's deserving. But I was born to love you. Some made for days some made for nights. Some to stand up for what's right. No matter how hard the fight. I was born to love you. I love you. I live you. I love to live you. I live to love you. I was born to love you
743,Ben Harper,Rock,You don't believe that I love you. and even if that was true. why just to keep our unhappy home. I'm gonna try to pretend that I do. but I'm breakin' down. I'm breakin' down. I'm breakin' down. I'm breakin' down. My baby she left me. said she ain't comin' back around. I'm breakin' down. And if I thought that it was okay. for a grown man to cry. I would have filled up the whole mighty ocean. when she said goodbye. and I'm breakin' down. I'm breakin' down. I'm breakin' down. I'm breakin' down. you know my baby she left me. said she ain't comin' back around. I'm breakin' down. One day you said everything was just right. I don't see how it changed overnight. one day you said everything was so strong. the next day you turn to me and say. it's been wrong all along. Oh and now you won't eve look at me. you pass me by in the street and you won't even speak. I never meant to cause you any harm. how could two people start so close. and end up so far. I'm breakin' down. I'm breakin' down. I'm breakin' down.
744,Ben Harper,Rock,Oh — I sat down upon the church house steps. I sat down upon the church house steps. I sat down upon the church house. Down upon the church house steps. With all my hopes and dreams. All of my regrets. Oh — I sat down upon the church house steps. I sat down upon the church house steps. I sat down. I sat down upon the church house steps. With all I have lost. And with all I have been blessed. Oh — I sat down. Oh — I sat down. Oh — I sat down upon. I sat down upon the church house steps. I reached to the sky. As I hung my head and wept. Oh — I wept. Oh — I sat down. Oh — I sat down. I sat down. Oh — I sat down. If these wings should fail me. (Won't you) meet me with another pair
745,Ben Harper,Rock,Day breaks over the city of my childhood. Daybreak over the city I called home. Where the sage met the sea. And the groves were sweet and green. It's a city that lives only in my dreams. The groves where we played when we were children. The groves where we fooled around as teens. Those green groves are paved from la to santa fe. That city lives only in my dreams. Landmarks lost to parking lots in the city I called home. Looking back I see what used to be. Now freeways crawl though the suburban sprawl. As far as the eye can see. And the city lives only in my dreams. Twilight shades the valley of my memory. When citrus groves still perfumed the sky. But I guess those orange blossoms. Weren't so special after all. Now it's a city of days gone by. Landmarks lost to parking lots in the city I called home. Looking back I see what used to be. Now freeways crawl through the suburban sprawl. As far as the eye can see. And the city lives only in my dreams
746,Ben Harper,Rock,If it hurts do it twice. avoid the void. don't miss out on your life. like a pair of shoes. hanging from a wire. i have no idea how we got here. time it can't erase the look upon a face. when a smile goes to waste. i'm tired of being sick. you're sick of being tired. i have no idea how we got here. there is no breath left for words. they have all been spoken for. all we say just shatters to the ground. clearly severely
747,Ben Harper,Rock,Sit there and call me. A liar and a cheat. I just wish you'd pin a rose on me. Now you won't even. Come out and take a bow. Cryin' won't help you now. Now your poets. Have all put down their pens. The only songs to sing. Are those sung again. Lonely just doesn't. Look good on you somehow. Cryin' wont help you now. I just keep on staring. Into the black eyes of the truth. We'll have to learn to live apart somehow. Cryin' wont help you now
748,Ben Harper,Rock,You say what's mine is mine. and what's yours is mine too. now you've got more than you can spend. but all of the money. in the whole wide world. is not gonna help you in the end. now while there's still time to be saved. don't take that attitude to your grave. might be too late for you I'm afraid. don't take that attitude to your grave. don't you take it there. I hear helicopters. over my house every day. shining their lights and flying low. treat a child like a criminal. from the day that he is born. and you're gonna reap just what you sow. now while there's still time to be saved. don't take that attitude to your grave. might be too late for you I'm afraid. don't take that attitude to your grave. don't you take it there. So you can move your court case. way across town. you can move it across the whole wide globe. but it ain't gonna help your court case. up in the sky. when you go to put on your white robe. now while there's still time to be saved. don't take that attitude to your grave. might be too late for you I'm afraid. don't take that attitude to your grave. don't you take it there. And you dare the children. to stay off of drugs. now I dare you to stop letting them in. and how dare you point your finger. at a gang out on the street. while it's you who is committing the sin. now while there's still time to be saved. don't take that attitude to your grave. might be too late for you I'm afraid. don't take that attitude to your grave. don't you take it there. they don't want it there. you know your mother taught you better. don't take that attitude to your grave.
749,Ben Harper,Rock,When I want you in my arms. When I want you and your charms. Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream. Dream dream dream. When I feel blue in the night. And I need you to hold me tight. Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream. . I can make you mine. Taste your lips of wine. Anytime night or day. Only trouble is gee whiz. I'm dreaming my life away. . I need you so I could die. I love you so that is why. Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream. Dream dream dream
750,Ben Harper,Rock,You may be a cheap date. But my therapy's expensive as hell. Then you pay a psychic healer who let's you know. Things aren't working out so well. Tommorow's shining off our face. Yesterday's shadow's at our back. Why must you always dress in black. People don't take advice. They just give it. And the only way you're ever gonna learn. Is to live it. So what you spent your younger years. Parlaying on the wrong side of the track. Why must you always dress in black. If you have to lie. Do it quickly and as thoroughly as you can. This morning i woke up slow. Feeling like a shell of a man. Don't blame me for us you cried. Just cut me some slack. Why must you always dress in black. She wore high heels. The ones that can pierce your heart. Just 'cause you go down in history. Doesn't mean your really all that smart. Like robert e. lee you're at your best. When under attack. Why must you always dress in black. You call in sick on monday. Tuesday you show up late. Wednesday you left early. Thursday you fight with a boss you hate. Friday you up and quit. Saturday you want your old job back. Sunday morning you wake up. All dressed in black. Why must you always dress in black
751,Ben Harper,Rock,I wish i was a thought. I'd run all through your mind. And come out being everything. You ever tried to find. Life's the longest picture. You're ever gonna take. Love's the longest promise. That you're ever gonna break. It's an engraved invitation. To leave all this time we've been wasting. I wish i could yell sorry. Louder than i screamed. All of those other things. I said but didn't mean. Some days i'm the lord's servant. Some days i'm satan's pawn. Some days i just wish. The voices in my head were gone. It's an engraved invitation. To leave all this time we've been wasting. The sun's a moon that warms you. The moon's a sun with no heat. The sky above is to remind you. What's under your feet. This life's not big enough. To fit our love inside. 'cause i remember you from heaven. The last time i died. It's an engraved invitation. To leave all this time we've been wasting
752,Ben Harper,Rock,You so easily amuse. like a pantomime. such a silent crime. You so easily abuse. lack of confidence. it's your best offense. You so easily confuse. you can't deny it. still you try to hide it. Faded. so faded. like a memory gone. there's no recollection. Faded. so faded. like a forgotten dream. further than it seems. You so hastily defy. when you think you need it. you find a way to bleed it. You so hastily deny. pleading innocence. it's your best defense. You so hastily reply. the moment that you said it. already regret it. Faded. so faded. like a memory gone. there's no recollection. Faded. so faded. like a forgotten dream. further than it seems.
753,Ben Harper,Rock,We stood in the dark. With our hands over each other's heart. we didn't waste a word. Grace is love undeserved. I've give up. I've give in. I've give out. And back again. Now that we're in from the cold. Our days are made of gold. What has benn lived. Can't be changed. but what we have lost. Can still be reclaimed. And i won't let you down. When you feel love. You remind me i can feel love. We sleep and share the same dream love. When we feel love
754,Ben Harper,Rock,If you're gonna live. then live it up. and if you're gonna give. then give it up. if you're gonna walk the earth. then walk it proud. and if you're gonna say the word. you got to say it loud. you got to fight for your mind. you got to fight for your mind. while you got the time. you got to fight for your mind. if you're gonna build a house. make it a home. if you're gonna pull some weight. pull your own. if you're gonna help. reach out your hand. if you're getting up. then take a stand. you got to fight for your mind. you got to fight for your mind. while you got the time. you got to fight for your mind. if you're gonna step. step on in. if you're gonna finish. you got to begin. don't you fear. what you don't know. just let that be. your room to grow. you got to fight for your mind. you got to fight for your mind. while you got the time. you got to fight for your mind.

759,Ben Harper,Rock,I found hay in a stack of needles. Four-leaf clover in a mile of weeds. Understands my downs. Puts up with my needs. Of everybody under the sun. I found the one. If you're gonna gamble. May as well be on love. May have had some before. But now you can't get enough. Before it's all said and done. I found the one. Found myself in trouble. Found myself waiting in line. Found so many ways. Of wasting my time. No more races to run. I found the one. Now I follow my heart. Wherever the road ends. Most people you see every day. You'll never see them again. Come rain come sun. Found the one
760,Ben Harper,Rock,Gather 'round the stone. You're too young to know. That you're too young to go. There's no freedom to be found. Lying face up in the ground. Gather 'round the stone. Ashes from an unfinished life. Are all that's left. In a tear-drop-shaped locket. Hanging from his mother's chest. Gather 'round the stone. You whip the back of freedom. ‘till it bleeds an oil stream. Then you sail down upon it. In your killing machine. Gather 'round the stone. Old men who send children. Off to die in vain.

783,Ben Harper,Rock,I Could paint the sun and the moon. And the stars straight down from the sky. Carve your likeness in stone. Down to the light that shines in your eyes. Build a church in your honor. Stained glass windows facing east. Loving you is my masterpiece. Love you for who you are. I love you for who you may never be. From downtown all the way up to 142nd street. And all of my possessions mean less than the very least. Loving you is my masterpiece. There's no time like now. There is no place like here. So throw your loving arms around me dear. And I'll lean on you like a beggar. Leans upon the moonlit streets. Loving you is my masterpiece
784,Ben Harper,Rock,Goodbye. Hasn't been so good to me. Stepped out into the night. Back against the moon. I saw ten thousand hands with candlelight. We all think that we're right. It's hard to tell. If the night is full of hope or doom. My eyes. Burn with unshed tears. My body is weak. From so many silent years. Too many people say goodbye. Before they say hello. Step into the morning. And disappear. What more than sorry can i say. What more than sorry can i be. Before our love fades away. What more than sorry. Do you want from me

787,Ben Harper,Rock,Like an old man. Sitting alone at a lunch counter. Like a small town girl. A big city devours. Some of us laugh. Even in our darkest hour. Never leave lonely alone. Unspoken rules of solitude. Wound without a trace. A lifetime of dreams roll down your face. All that we can't say. Is all we need to hear. When you close your eyes. Does the world disappear. There's something in everyone. Only they know. It moves in the hidden ways. Of joy and sorrow. Never leave lonely alone
788,Ben Harper,Rock,i'm serenaded by a chorus. of a thousand burning cigarettes. you've been taking chances mama. while i've been placing bets. so tell it to the ashes. they know we served. it may be good for the soul. but it's hard on the nerves. the very thing that drives you. can drive you insane. got a head full of thought crimes. and a number with no name. got an eleventh hour Jesus. and a mouth full of blame. a casket lined with silver dollars. and a number with no name. there's nowhere to run. i've got no one to tell. my face has become a mask. and i'm not wearing it well. for five days straight. i've been breathing fire. don't have room on my body

790,Ben Harper,Rock,When the people lead. the leaders they will have to follow. and all their lies and their alibies. they will have to swallow. and it's you that has the authority. for the one who is right. is the majority. when the people lead. people take the lead. children you've got to take your lead. or you shall be led astray. so as long as someone else. controls your history. the truth shall remain just a mystery. for you can lead a horse to the water. but you cannot make him drink. you can put a man through school. but you cannot make him think. when the people lead. people take the lead. children you've got to take your lead. or you shall be led astray. watch them try to hide. this world's imposition. but like disease that has come round from remission. when it seems. as if it has left your person. all the while it has only worsened. when the people lead. people take the lead. children you've got to take your lead. or you shall be led astray.
791,Ben Harper,Rock,It hangs above my altar. Like they hung Him from a cross. I keep one in my wallet. For the times I feel lost. In a wooden frame with splinters. Where my family kneels to pray. And if you listen close. You'll hear the words He used to say. I've got a picture of Jesus. In His arms so many prayers rest. We've got a picture of Jesus. And with Him we shall be forever blessed. Now it has been spoken. He would come again. But would we recognize. This king among men. There was a man in our time. His words shine bright like the sun. He tried to lift the masses. And was crucified by gun. He was a picture of Jesus. With Him so many prayers rest. He is a picture of Jesus. In His arms so many prayers rest. With Him we shall be forever blessed. Somedays have no beginning. Some days have no end. Some roads are straight and narrow. And some roads only bend. So let us say a prayer. For every living thing. Walking towards a light. From the cross of a King. We long to be a picture of Jesus. In His arms so many prayers rest. I long to be a picture of Jesus. With Him we shall be forever blessed..
792,Ben Harper,Rock,You're the first one to get there. And always the last one to leave. You're the first one to chuckle. But the last one to grieve. I know all too well the world takes a daily beating. Please don't talk about murder while i'm eating. You walk into the temple. And call it a church. I try to keep things simple. But you always need the works. Your life is marked by numbers and symbols. Excessive drinking from out of golden thimbles. Just a moment of silence i'm needing. So let's not talk about murder while i'm eating. You get all hot and bothered. At the strangest times and places. But don't notice the looks on all the other faces. You're dressed for summer in the middle of december. What you've all but forgotten. I painfully remember. I don't care in the least what you're reading. Please don't talk about murder while i'm eating
793,Ben Harper,Rock,I'm leaving here on the morning train. and I will never see this world again. I've felt pleasure. and I have felt pain. and I know now. that I can never be the same. How I wonder why the world can be so cold. and if only good die young. then left with me cruel here to grow old. and I felt pleasure. an I felt pain. and I know now. I can never be the same. And if someday I find my peace of mind. I will share my wealth with all of human kind. I've felt pleasure. and I have felt pain. and I know now. that I can never be the same. So if the sun does shine or rain does fall. I give thanks I've had my sight to see through it all. and I've felt pleasure. and I have felt pain. and I know now. that I can never be the same.
794,Ben Harper,Rock,It will make a weak man mighty. it will make a mighty man fall. it will fill your heart and hands. or leave you with nothing at all. it's the eyes for the blind. and legs for the lame. it is love for hate. and pride for shame. that's the power of the gospel. that's the power of the gospel. that's the power of the mighty power. that's the power of the gospel. gospel on the water. gospel on the land. the gospel in every woman. the gospel in every man. gospel in the garden. gospel in the trees. the gospel that's inside of you. the gospel inside of me. that's the power of the gospel. that's the power of the gospel. that's the power of the mighty power. that's the power of the gospel. in the hour of richness. in the hour of need. for all of creation. comes from the gospel seed. now you may leave tomorrow. and you may leave today. but you've got to have the gospel. when you start out on your way. that's the power of the gospel. that's the power of the gospel. that's the power of the mighty power. that's the power of the gospel
795,Ben Harper,Rock,Silence is the hammer of betrayal. Upon love's coffin for the final nail. Disguised as one another for so long now. I try to be myself but i forget how. Pray that our love sees the dawn. Pray that our love sees the dawn. My last line of defense is gone. Pray that our love sees the dawn. Homeless family stands outside the church house. Trying so hard to believe. Desperately waiting for an answer to the candle the lit. To end their grief. Pray that our love sees the dawn. Pray that our love sees the dawn.

We could melt away all of our blame. Pray that our love sees the dawn. Pray that our love sees the dawn. We've knocked our bones together for so long. Pray that our love sees the dawn. Pray that our love sees the dawn. Pray that our love sees the dawn. Our last line of defense is gone. Pray that our love sees the dawn
796,Ben Harper,Rock,she eats nectarines with honey. spends her daddy's money so easy. she cuts cherry pie. while she looks you in the eye. so easy. the innocent naiveté of. hairless cheek. the politics of generosity. make me weak. there's an assassin out to get me. and they claim that. she's never missed. the one with an ex-lover. whom she claims. to have never kissed. we turned at twenty paces. for love is a duel. and we stood still as stone. i can't imagine that. this is in the best interest. of flesh and bone. i've been living in the city. for much too long. there's a neon sign in my mind. flashing right and wrong. i can't afford your company. i spent my money buying time. i was lost out in the desert while. you were busy swimming in wine. you put it on me. then left me lonely
797,Ben Harper,Rock,Can't know the hell you love. But i know you've had enough. Some baptize in water. Some in flames. What has life done to you. All you ever wanted was someone to run to you. There's more to life than what makes you cry. Don't you give me a reason to mourn. Look into my eyes with all your hate and scorn. I'll remove the crown of sorrow which you have been adorned. But don't you give me a reason to mourn

799,Ben Harper,Rock,Say goodbye to tomorrow. And hello to today. Take a look at your world. In a brand new way. The masters of convention. Count on you to never change. But the law of reinvention. Knows nothing stays the same. Rock n' roll is free if you want it. Rock n' roll is free so come and get it. Rock n' roll is free if you want it. Free if you want it. They're crying in the alleys. Screaming in the streets. With a dignity amongst thieves. You don't have to answer. If the question isn't clear. May not know where i am. But i?m glad it?s here. Say goodbye to tomorrow. And hello to today. Take a look at your world. In a brand new way. Pick the price you want to pay. If you think you should. But i have heard the news. And the news is good. Rock n' roll is free if you want it. Rock n' roll is free so come and get it. Rock n' roll is free if you want it. Free if you want it. Free. If. You. Want. It
800,Ben Harper,Rock,I could have treated you better. but you couldn't have treated me worse. but it's he who laughs last. is he who cries first. Sometimes I feel I know strangers. better than I know my friends. why must a beginning. be the means to an end. The stones from my enemies. these wounds will mend. but I cannot survive. the roses from my friends. When the last word has been spoken. and we've beared witness to the final setting sun. all that shall remain is a token. of what we've said and done. When all we've had has been forsaken. distant church bells no longer ring. that's the sound of a heart taken. and the story of tears from a king. The stones from my enemies. these wounds will mend. but I cannot survive. the roses from my friends. This may be the last time I see you. forgive me for holding you close. this may be the last time that I see you. so of this moment I will make the most. This may be the last time I see you. but if you keep me in your heart. together we shall be eternal. if you believe. we shall never part. The stones from my enemies. these wounds will mend. but I cannot survive. the roses from my friends.
801,Ben Harper,Rock,baby say it's all right. if it takes all night. we won't have to be alone. if you say you will. like marie antoinette. said to louis xvi. man i think we're going down. our chances are slim and none. and i'm afraid slim just left town. now you've had me hanging. all on your line. but i know all too well. love ain't nothin' but. a worried mind. i love you like. a candle loves a flame. like a crying man. that has no shame. when you hit me i feel no pain. like the last days that remain. say you will
802,Ben Harper,Rock,battles over which direction to kneel. people reaching out to touch. but forgetting to feel. daily breath shouldn't be a daily penance. is that what you believe. or just a life sentence. i look into the mirror. and i see someone there i used to know. they all want you to serve them. but the only one you got to serve. is your soul. so much time. and at such a cost. we spend looking for what we've lost. now that you know. you can't find it from him. you're gonna have to find it within. i look into the mirror. and i see that life has taken its toll. they'll all want you to serve them. but the only one you got to serve. is your soul. listen to the wind it won't lie to you. if you love it let it go. and watch it fly to you. every setting sun gently weeps. you can always hear it. 'cause trust never sleeps
803,Ben Harper,Rock,I know you may not want to see me. On your way down from the clouds. Would you hear me if I told you. That my heart is with you now. She's only happy in the sun. Did you find what you were after. The pain and the laughter brought. You to your knees. But if the sun sets you free. You'll be free indeed. She's only happy in the sun. Every time I hear you laughing. It makes me cry. Like the story of her life. Is hello and goodbye. She's only happy in the sun
804,Ben Harper,Rock,Once you know. You can never turn back. But I understand. 'Cause we all fear what we lack. Being with you. Makes me tired as hell. And it's so high so low. Now if I was strong. And you were male. You'd be dead. And I would be in jail. Being with you. Makes me tired as hell. And it's so high so low. Don't go making promises. You know you won't keep. Weddings turn to funerals. Both with songs that make you weep. Being with you. Makes me tired as hell. And it's so high so low
805,Ben Harper,Rock,Things are looking up today. How long have I been Looking Down. Traded a Blue Sky Today. For the Cold Hard Ground. (chorus). Don't let one day go to waste. I'm filling space. I'm spilling faith. Things are Looking up Today. I didn't have to look away. There's to much to be said. for letting go. So much Tomorrow only Knows. (chorus). Today it all Become so Clear. Looked out my window. not in my mirror. Make the book that is your life. Worth Reading. (chorus). If we love long Enough. We can get there from here
806,Ben Harper,Rock,Lord I work to serve you. And I hope I've served you well. Oh — I've lived a life to join you. And now only time will tell. Oh — Take my hand when you are worried. Take my hand when you're alone. Take my hand and let me guide you. Take my hand to lead you home. Father dear father. Pulled his car to the side of the road. Looked at his children with tears in his eyes. Said life is too heavy a load. Take my hand when you are worried. Take my hand when you're alone. Take my hand and let me guide you. Take my hand to lead you home. Some days I'm struck with sorrow. Need a place to hide. There's nowhere else you can put life. But way down deep inside. Take my hand and let me guide you. Take my hand when you're alone. Take my hand and let me guide you. Take my hand to lead you home. Take my hand when you are worried. Take my hand to lead you home. Take my hand and let me guide you. Take my hand to lead you home. Take my hand...
807,Ben Harper,Rock,I killed a snake with a bible. I was living a Johnny Cash song. I'm afraid for this I may be liable. So it`s best I be moving - moving along. Just a temporary remedy. Running through my. Running through my veins. Summer lasted through November. Funny when it`s gone you miss cold. Words can be spoken for a lifetime. We can never hear until we're told. Just a temporary remedy. Running through my. Running through my veins. They tell me nothing is perfect. Then tell me why is it a word. Yesterday's news is tomorrow's blues. Now they're perfectly blurred. Just a temporary remedy. Running through. Running through my veins. Just a temporary remedy. Running through. Running through my veins
808,Ben Harper,Rock,Sometimes I make choices. Sometimes they make me. Lonesome distance between here. And where you think I should be. Someday we may look back and laugh. At all that could've been. But tonight the bottle wins again. Broken hearts and broken dreams. Turns out they weigh the same. Passed down through generations. Like the family name. There's a gilded coat of arms. For those who heal from within. But tonight the bottle wins again. So meet me in an hour. We'll have just one or two. You pretend to listen. I'll act like I can hear you. I know you'll always be there. Ain't that a true friend. Tonight the bottle wins again
809,Ben Harper,Rock,I met a girl whose heart. was on the right hand side. and upon the left. an angel did reside. they told her mother. that she never would survive. but she kept the rhythm. and is still alive. We must all have. the will to live. you got to have. the will to live. Then I met a man. who had to walk with his hands. born into a world. he couldn't stand. blessed with life. but cursed as a man. still he walks taller. than most of us can. We must all have. the will to live. you got to have. the will to live. Some are born with more. and some born with less. so don't take for granted. the life we've been blessed. it's hard to understand. that we're only a guest. and each one of us. shall be put to life's test. We must all have. the will to live. you got to have. the will to live.
810,Ben Harper,Rock,The word suicide is irresponsible. still you offered to buy me a gun. what's so hard about sympathy. love is a lonely room. when out on the edge. there's just two directions. and somebody has to lose. I should know better than to use words. like never and hate. love is a lonely room. this is no way to live. and this is no way to die. who in the hell's life is this. I'm living anyway. love is a lonely room
811,Ben Harper,Rock,i wish we could live forever. then melt into the sun. time is gonna change you. once it gets you on the run. i've been running. ever since i was a child. some call it free. some call it wild. let the warmth of my love. dry away all your tears. fear not for i am with you. i will fear not with you here. there will be a light
812,Ben Harper,Rock,I need to sleep. But I'm too tired. I need to come down. But I'm too wired. When the sun comes up. I miss the moon. I know tomorrow. Is gonna come too soon. She only wants to be wanted. But time crumbles blue roses to dust. Now I long to feel. The touch from your lust. Scars on your back. Tell where you've been. But I'll roll like the ocean. If you'll blow like the wind. Sweet Texas angel. What have your blue eyes seen. I'll be your country gentleman. If you will be my Mason Dixon queen. She only wants to be wanted. But time crumbles blue roses to dust. Now I long to feel. The touch from your lust. So much sweeter. Than all the rest. You're what lies. Between pain and death. Sinners and saints. Call you by name. If you're gonna take the praise. You're gonna have to learn to take the blame. She only wants to be wanted. But time crumbles blue roses to dust. Now I long to feel. The touch from your lust.
813,Ben Harper,Rock,I've been waiting for you (x2). Never found anything else to do. But waiting for you. I've been calling your name (x2). Never found anything else to say. Nothing to say. refrão:. You can kill a lot of time. If you really want to put your mind to it. Or leave it all behind. If you never want to go through it. I keep hearing your name (x2). Nothing else sounds the same. As hearing your name. refrão (x1). I've been hoping for you. Keep hoping for you. What else can i do. But to keep hoping for you. refrão (x1). What else can i do. Keep waiting for you
814,Ben Harper,Rock,Waiting on an angel. One to carry me home. Hope you come to see me soon. Cause I don't want to go alone. I don't want to go alone. Now angel won't you come by me. Angel hear my plea. Take my hand lift me up. So that I can fly with thee. So that I can fly with thee. And I'm waiting on an angel. And I know it won't be long. To find myself a resting place. In my angel's arms. In my angel's arms. So speak kind to a stranger. Cause you'll never know. It just might be an angel come. Knockin' at your door. Knockin' at your door. And I'm waiting on an angel. And I know it won't be long. To find myself and rest in peace. In my angel's arms. In my angel's arms. Waiting on an angel. One to carry me home. Hope you come to see me soon. Cause I don't want to go alone. I don't want to go alone. Don't want to go. I don't want to go alone
815,Ben Harper,Rock,Oh no. Here comes that sun again. That means another day. Without you my friend. And it hurts me. To look into the mirror at myself. And it hurts even more. To have to be with somebody else. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away. With so many people. To love in my life. Why do I worry. About one. But you put the happy. In my ness. You put the good times. Into my fun. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away. And head for the door. We've tried the goodbye. So many days. We walk in the same direction. So that we could never stray. They say if you love somebody. Than you have got to set them free. But I would rather be locked to you. Than live in this pain and misery. They say time will. Make all this go away. But it's time that has taken my tomorrows. And turned them into yesterdays. And once again that rising sun. Is dropping on down. And once again you my friend. Are nowhere to be found. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away. And head for the door. You just walk away. Walk away
816,Ben Harper,Rock,There's a man on the corner. Begging for help. There's a man that walks past him. And he's drowning in wealth. Who doesn't understand. How disappointment destroys the soul. Every look of shame. Is a wound that will never heal. What has he done to deserve this. What have I done to deserve this. It's easy to remember. But it's easier to forget. Life has a way of getting in our way. I don't want to go my way. If you're not going my way. So I guess that means. I'll be going your way. I will lead or follow. Beg steal or borrow. Just for one more day. We can't end this way
817,Ben Harper,Rock,Welcome to the cruel world. hope you find your way. welcome to the cruel world. hope you find your way. it's a cruel world. try to enjoy your stay. Yes it is a cruel world. when you're tryin' to get by. it's a cruel world. when you've seen the look in their eye. makes life hard living. but I'm so scared to die. Welcome to the cruel world. welcome. welcome. Don't know how. we've lasted here so long. there must be more good than bad. or we'd already be gone. and if you get up to Heaven. before I do. I'm gonna tell ya. It's gonna be cruel there too. You can't hide from this cruel world. cause there is no place to run. you can't hide from the cruel world. there just is no place to run. it's been cruel from the beginning. it will be cruel when we're done. So when I'm gone. I will gladly say goodbye. when I am gone. I will gladly say goodbye. and if you want to feel me. put your hands up to the sky. Welcome to the cruel world. welcome. welcome. hope you find your way. try to enjoy your stay.
818,Ben Harper,Rock,There's no deals to be made with the dawn. Now I fear that our time has come and gone. They say freedom is just a place to hide. Now I'm coming to you with my arms open wide. (Oh - won't you tell me). Where could I go to the Lord. Take a prayer with you to heaven for me. Oh - And give it to the Lord. Give it to the Lord. Cause nothing else could save a sinner. Sinner like me. Oh - But an angel's word. Just an angel's word. Now - Oh now - what is - what is too true. What is hard is much too true. Oh - and what's true Oh - is much too too hard. And now where - where could I go but to the Lord. Mama was hard on us but we could take it. And papa didn't give a damn and he couldn't fake it. They say freedom. Oh - Freedom is just an other place to hide. Now I'm coming to you with my arms open wide. (And tell me). Where could I go - Oh - but to the Lord. . /lovelydoll

I'm gonna need someplace to go. he's no longer some kind woman's son. mama I think that I had better run. I'm the widow of a living man.
822,Ben Harper,Rock,I sit here in a daze. Wishing I could change my ways. And let's not pretend it isn't what it is. Its time we both go on and live. You found another lover. And I lost another friend. We've been living like it's raining. When it's just been pouring down sun. We've been living as if life is over. When it has only just begun. You found another lover. And I lost another friend. I may lie to my heart. But my heart never lies to me. I'm defenseless. Repentless. And there is nothing I can do to prevent this. You found another lover. And I lost another friend
823,Ben Harper,Rock,you and i were looking at. old pictures yesterday. sitting in disbelief at. how time slips away. both at a loss for words to say. knew we'd never be. younger than today. foolishness protected us. from the world outside. they could never come between. us but we knew they'd try. we remembered living as. if there were a way. to forever be younger than today. never looked at anything. you didn't care to see. i was the one who wouldn't. let you leave. even though it was clear. you couldn't stay. had to try to be. younger than today. as we parted you. reminded me i'm alive. to remember when the stars. danced just for you and i. may the shimmer of summer. always light your way. and make you feel. younger than today. . felipe

When he leaves you lonely. 'Cause I wanna be your one and only. Oh honey you gotta blow out the candle. Is a new flame too much to handle. Oh honey you gotta put out the old love. And let the new love begin. And let the new love begin. .

The whole root and heavy core will perish and starve in captivity. You will never win your freedom. You cannot escape... F. E. A. R

I'd like to think you'd hear this song and turn it all around. But I know. This is a condition. That you're living in. You've been living in. And this is a condition. That you're living in. And you won't win so. Turn it off and start it up again. Start it up again. Start it up again. Start it up again. It takes a sea of change. That I cannot explain. I can't wait for it to come.

I wish I could stop wishing you were here. But I don't want to - cos I still want you. I wish I didn't feel so flippin mad. Don't wanna scare you - just wanna love you. I wish my life could last a thousand years. Then I'd be clever - and build a heaven. I wish I could bring Nick Drake back to life. He'd understand - hold my hat band. I wish a constant stream of happy shit. Live forever - in world of leather. I wish the rain would just leave me alone. I can't wear that - stupid rain hat. I wish I was in Californ-I-A. Perno perfurme - in the Danube. I wish the thing of love meant just one thing. Cinderella - salmonella.

940,Blur,Rock,I look down from my window. To the island where I'm held. Listen while you're sleeping. Darkness is itself. Tomorrow I'm disappearing. Cause the trees are amplified. Never ending broadcasts. To each I cannot dispair. Kid the mausoleum's fallen. And the perfect avenues. Will seem empty without you. And the pink light that bathes. The great leaders is fading. By the time your sun is rising there. Out here it's turning blue. The silver rockets coming. And the cherry trees of pyongyang. Are leaving. I feel like I'm floating. Persisting autotune. The never ending gloom. To the palace of the doom. The temperature keeps falling. Soon there will be no lights. Just a red glow of glass coffins. Watched by someone through the night. Kid the mausoleum's fallen. And the perfect avenues. Will seem empty without you. And the pink light that bathes. The great leaders is fading. By the time your sun is rising there. Out here it's turning blue. The silver rockets coming. And the cherry trees of pyongyang. I'm leaving. (Soon there will be no light. Someone through the night). Kid the mausoleum's fallen. And the perfect avenues. Will seem empty without you. And the pink light that bathes. The great leaders is fading. By the time your sun is rising there. Out here it's turning blue. The silver rockets coming. And the cherry trees of pyongyang. But I'm leaving

On a Camel Light. And on a magic carpet. He’ll fly away tonight. Open sesame... T.O.P.M.A.N.. He sees her in double. Then pukes on the pavement. Likes her all clean and shaven. Shooting guns on the high street of love.

984,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,Here I lie forever. Sorrow still remains. Will the water pull me down and wash it all away. Come and take me over. Welcome to the game. Will the current drag me down and carry me away. Suddenly the light begins to fade. Hopeless. I'm falling down. Filthy. I can't wake up. I can not hold on. I will not let go. Worthless. It's over now. Guilty. There's no way out. I can not hold on. I will not let go. Silent I go under. I am not afraid. I can see the daylight shine. And slowly drift away. Safe to say it's over. Sink into the grave. There is nothing left inside. But I am wide awake. I can hear the devil call my name. Hopeless. I'm falling down. Filthy. I can't wake up. I can not hold on. I will not let go. Worthless. It's over now. Guilty. There's no way out. I can not hold on. I will not let go
985,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,Screaming on the inside. I am frail and withered. Cover up the wounds. That I can't hide. Walls that lie between us. The saint within the sinner. I have lost the nerve. But it's all right. Carry the wounded and shut your eyes. All will be forgiven. None will rise. Bury the fallen and lead the blind. I will fight the loss. Dead inside. Into the nothing. Faded and weary. I won't leave and let you fall behind. Live for the dying. Heaven hear me. I know we can make it out alive. Leave me at the bottom. I am lost forever. Letters from the dead. Say goodbye. Sorrow falls upon us. This will be the last time. Days begin to end. But I'll get by. Follow the hopeless. And shut your eyes. All will be abandoned. None will shine. Gather the broken and leave this life. Lying in the earth. Side by side. Into the nothing. Faded and weary. I won't leave and let you fall behind. Live for the dying. Heaven hear me. I know we can make it out alive. I'll keep you inside. Where I lead you cannot follow. Straight into the light. As my breath grows still and shallow. Into the nothing. Faded and weary. I won't leave and let them fall behind. Live for the dying. Heaven hear me. I know we can make it out alive. Stay with me. You're all I have left. I know we can make it out alive. Stay with me. You're all I have left. I know we can make it out alive
986,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,What did you say to me. I'm not a novelty. You're playing revelry. But no one's listening. I am a simple man. Without a simple plan. Let's make it easier. And just get out while we can. I'm the one you want. Hey Ladybug. You were always on the mind of everyone. Ladybug. You're pathetic and I've said it more than once. Ladybug. I believe you couldn't reach me where I am. Where my feet won't hit the ground. The time is passing by. You're my insecticide. The pressure's on the rise. I arrived well in time. Beautiful enemy. I'll fix your broken wings. And let you lie here until. You fly away from me. I'm the one you want. Hey Ladybug. You were always on the mind of everyone. Ladybug. You're pathetic and I've said it more than once. Ladybug. I believe you couldn't reach me where I am. Where my feet won't hit the ground. What did you say to me. I'm only here to clip your wings. You cut me down to size. I'm only living my life. Ladybug. You were always on the mind of everyone. Ladybug. You're pathetic and I've said it more than once. Ladybug. I believe you couldn't reach me where I am. Where my feet won't hit the ground. Where my feet won't hit the ground. Where my feet won't hit the ground. Where my feet won't hit the ground
987,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,No named bars dead end stars. Empty roads to nowhere. Unlocked cars life's so far. There's no here to get there. As fast as I run. Could you catch me for once. It's the last time I learn my lesson the hard way. Because you lie. Because I just love to hate you. Because you lie to me. Cold and clean perfect dream. I don't ever want them. Hand me down white washed town. Another bully anthem. As fast as I run. Could you catch me for once. It's the last time I learn my lesson the hard way. Because you lie. Because I just love to hate you. Because you lie to me. You lie. You lie to me. You lie. You lie to me. You lie. You lie to me. As fast I run. Could you catch me for once.

Would you want to ?. Feel the way that I do?. While I bend to your will. I've felatted myself. Tied to the needle. My drunk libido. Mind your own ego. The faster we go. You are an asshole. King of the castle. I am the meager. Follow the leader. Would you want to. Feel the way that I do?. While I bend to your will. I've felatted myself. And I know that you don't.

995,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,Lies are spoken. When the venom crawls inside. Faith is broken. When the fire fills our eyes. Love lies hopeless. When the hate becomes the high. Pain is chosen. When the devil comes alive. (Daylight falls). So save yourself. I leave this world tonight. There's nothing left. I see the sun rise. My dying breath. I keep this prayer alive. Rain is closing. When you're caught between the lines. Faith is forfeit. When the hollow fills our eyes. Hate lies hopeless. When the heart and soul divide. Pain is worthless. When the shadow comes alive. (Daylight falls). So save yourself. I leave this world tonight. There's nothing left. I see the sun rise. My dying breath. I keep this prayer alive. So save yourself. I leave this world tonight. There's nothing left. I see the sun rise. My dying breath. I keep this prayer alive

997,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,Carry me all through the night. I am the last light fading. Leave all the lost souls behind. Show me the silence breaking. And when you're lost and out of time. I will be right here waiting. And when your dreams return to life. I'll be forever fading. And we'll fall behind. So I'll wait for you. As I keep your faith alive. And I'll pray for you. As we cross the great divide. Bury the wounds deep inside. Rupture the fault line breaking. Dream of the world left behind. Show us we're worth forsaking. And when the cold begins to rise. Darkness is overtaking. And when the fear is satisfied. I'll be forever changing. As we all realize. So I'll wait for you. As I keep your faith alive. And I'll pray for you. As we cross the great divide. And I'll break for you. As I open up the sky. And I'll stay for you. As we cross the great divide. Follow the sun light down. Cry clear and loud. Heaven won't help us now. But it's better this way. Warm light wash me away. So I'll wait for you. As I keep your faith alive. And I'll pray for you. As we cross the great divide. And I'll break for you. As I open up the sky. And I'll stay for you. As we cross the great divide

999,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,Take this life. I will make you. I will start the pain within. I will crave you. I will learn to hate again. I will drain you. I will make you whole again. I will blame you. I will lay beside the dead. 'Cause I don't want to live inside this hell. Tame the fire from within. You won't break me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. I won't save you. I won't starve the hope within. I won't change you. I won't fight the pain within. I won't fail you. I won't let your light descend. I won't play you. I won't face your fate again. 'Cause I am born to live inside this hell. Tame the fire from within. You won't break me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. Tame the fire from within. You won't take me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. Let the calm rise up. So graceful. Every wasted word. So faithful. Tame the fire from within. You won't break me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. Tame the fire from within. You won't take me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. Suffocate me. Suffocate me
1000,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,Take a breath. Hold it in. Start a fight. You won't win. Had enough. Let's begin. Nevermind. I don't care. All in all. You're no good. You don't cry. Like you should. Let it go. If you could. When love dies in the end. So I'll find what lies beneath. Your sick twisted smile. As I lay underneath. Your cold jaded eyes. Now you turn the tide on me. 'Cause you're so unkind. I will always be here. For the rest of my life. Here we go. Does it hurt. Say goodbye. to this world. I will not. Be undone. Come to life. It gets worse. All in all. You're no good. You don't cry. Like you should. I'll be gone. when you fall. Your sad life. Says it all. So I'll find what lies beneath. Your sick twisted smile. As I lay underneath. Your cold jaded eyes. Now you turn the tide on me. 'Cause you're so unkind. I will always be here. For the rest of my life. Don't carry me under. You're the Devil in disguise.

1001,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,There's no time for us. There's no place for us. What is this thing that builds our dreams. And slips away from us?. Who wants to live forever?. Who wants to live forever. There's no chance for us. It's all decided for us. This world has only one sweet moment. Set aside for us. Who wants to live forever?. Who dares to love forever?. When love must die?. Oh! Touch my tears with your lips. Touch my world with your fingertips. And we can have forever. And we can love forever. Forever is ours today. Who wants to live forever?. Who wants to live forever?. Who waits forever anyway?
1002,Breaking Benjamin,Rock,My hands are broken and time is going on and on. It goes forever (how long). So I got high and lived all that life. I have taken all for granted. [Chorus]. Promise me you'll try to leave it all behind. 'Cause I've elected hell. Lying to myself. Why have I gone blind ?. Live another life. You. The only way out is letting your guard down. And never die forgotten (I know). Forgive me my love. I stand here all alone and I can see the bottom. (Repeat Chorus)
1003,Bring Me The Horizon,Rock,Some people are a lot like clouds you know. 'cause life's so much brighter when they go. You rained on my heart for far too long. Couldn't see the thunder for the storm. Because I cut my teeth. and bit my tongue. til' my mouth was dripping blood. but I never dished the dirt. just held my breath. while you dragged me through the mud. I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause. I can't save you from yourself. when all you give a shit about. is everybody else. And you just can't quit. Why don't you deal with it?. I think it's time to stop. You need a taste of your own medicine. Cos I'm sick to death of swallowing. watch me take the wheel like you. Not feel like you. Act like nothing's real like you. so I'm sorry for this. it might sting a bit. Some people are a lot like clouds you know. 'cause life's so much brighter when they go. and I spent too long in a place I don't belong. couldn't see the thunder for the storm. But you won't admit. Why don't you get a grip.

1005,Bring Me The Horizon,Rock,My secrets are burning a hole through my heart. And my bones catch a fever. When I cut you up this deep. It's hard to find a way to breathe. Your eyes are swallowing me. Mirrors start to whisper. Shadows start to sing. My skin's smothering me. Help me find a way to breathe. Time stood still. The way it did before. It's like I'm sleepwalking. Fell into another hole again. It's like I'm sleepwalking. I'm at the edge of the world. Where do I go from here?. Do I disappear?. Edge of the world. Should I sink or swim?. Or simply disappear?. Your eyes are swallowing me. Mirrors start to whisper. Shadows start to sing. My skin's smothering me. Help me find a way to breathe. Sing it.

1007,Bring Me The Horizon,Rock,Eyes like a car crash. I know I shouldn't look. But I can't turn away. Body like a whiplash. Salt my wounds but I can't heal the way. I feel about you. I watch you like a hawk. I watch you like I'm gonna tear you. Limb from limb. Will the hunger ever stop?. Can we simply starve this sin?. That little kiss you stole. It held my heart and soul. And like a deer in the headlights. I meet my fate. Don't try to fight the storm. You'll tumble overboard. Tides will bring me back to you. And on my deathbed all I'll see is you. The life may leave my lungs. But my heart will stay with you. That little kiss you stole. It held my heart and soul. And like a ghost in the silence I disappear. Don't try to fight the storm. You'll tumble overboard. Tide will bring me back to you. The waves will pull us under. Tides will bring me back to you. Tides will bring me back to you. That little kiss you stole. It held my heart and soul. And like a ghost in the silence I disappear. Don't try to fight the storm. You'll tumble overboard. Tides will bring me back to you. That little kiss you stole.

1012,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Hey little girl is your daddy home. Did he go away and leave you all alone. I got a bad desire. I'm on fire. Tell me now baby is he good to you. Can he do to you the things that I do. I can take you higher. I'm on fire. Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby. edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley. through the middle of my soul. At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet. and a freight train running through the. middle of my head. Only you can cool my desire. I'm on fire.
1013,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Well It's Saturday night. you're all dressed up in blue. I been watching you awhile. maybe you been watching me too. So somebody ran out. left somebody's heart in a mess.

Well 'round here baby. I learned you get what you can get. So if you're rough enough for love. honey I'm tougher than the rest. The road is dark. and it's a thin thin line. But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time. Maybe your other boyfriends. couldn't pass the test. Well if you're rough and ready for love. honey I'm tougher than the rest. Well it ain't no secret. I've been around a time or two. Well I don't know baby maybe you've been around too. Well there's another dance. all you gotta do is say yes.

1014,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade. I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade. I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch. I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Sit down' I stood up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing. I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could. sing. I pushed B-52 and bombed `em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on. standing. I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to. landing. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Come down' I threw. up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard. to hold your breath. I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared. I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress. Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little. place in the stars. I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said`Sit down'I stood up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. Ooh-ooh growin' up.
1015,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS. AS THE BAND PLAYS. WHAT ARE THOSE WORDS WHISPERED BABY. JUST AS YOU TURN AWAY. I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT. OUT ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.

1016,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,We busted out of class had to get away from those fools. We learned more from a three-minute record. That we ever learned in school. Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound. I can feel my heart begin to pound. You say you're tired and you just want to close. Your eyes and follow your dreams down. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrender. Now young faces grow sad and old and hearts. of fire grow cold. We swore blood brothers against the wind. I'm ready to grow young again. And hear yur sister's voice calling us home. Acroos the open yards. Believin' we could cut someplace of our own. With these drums and these guitars. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrender. Blood brother in the stormy night with a vow to defend. No retreat no surrender. Now on the street tonight the lights gro dim. The walls of my room are closing in. But it's good to see your smiling face. And to hear your voice again. We could sleep in the twilight. By the river bed. With a wide open country in our hearts. And these romantic dreams in our heads. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrende
1017,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Take me now baby here as I am. Pull me close try an understand. I work all day out in the hot sun. Stay with me now till the mornin' comes. Come on now try and understand. The way I feel when I'm in your hands. Take me now as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. What I got I have earned. What I'm not I have learned. Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe. Just stay in my bed till the morning comes. Come on now try and understand. The way I feel when I'm in your hands. Take me now as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. Because the night.... Your love is here and now. The vicious circle turns and burns without. Though I cannot live forgive me now. The time has come to take this moment and. They can't hurt you now. Because the night....
1018,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""Put on my blue suede shoes. And I boarded the plane. Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues. In the middle of the pouring rain. W.C. Handy -- won't you look down over me. Yeah I got a first class ticket. But I'm as blue as a boy can be. Then I'm walking in Memphis. I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. Walking in Memphis. But do I really feel the way I feel. Saw the ghost of Elvis. On Union Avenue. Followed him up to the gates of Graceland. Then I watched him walk right through. Now security they did not see him. They just hovered 'round his tomb. But there's a pretty little thing. Waiting for the King. Down in the Jungle Room. Then I'm walking in Memphis. I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. Walking in Memphis. But do I really feel the way I feel. They've got catfish on the table. They've got gospel in the air. And Reverend Green be glad to see you. When you haven't got a prayer. But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis. Now Muriel plays piano. Every Friday at the Hollywood. And they brought me down to see her. And they asked me if I would --. Do a little number. And I sang with all my might. And she said --. """"Tell me are you a Christian child?"""". And I said """"Ma'am I am tonight"""". Then I'm walking in Memphis. I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. Walking in Memphis. But do I really feel the way I feel. Put on my blue suede shoes. And I boarded the plane. Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues. In the middle of the pouring rain. Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues. In the middle of the pouring rain"""
1019,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""I bought a bourgeois house in the Hollywood hills. With a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills. Man came by to hook up my cable TV. We settled in for the night my baby and me. We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past dawn. There was fifty-seven channels and nothin' on. Well now home entertainment was my baby's wish. So I hopped into town for a satellite dish. I tied it to the top of my Japanese car. I came home and I pointed it out into the stars. A message came back from the great beyond. There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on. Well we might'a made some friends with some billionaires. We might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs. All I got was a note that said """"Bye-bye John. Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on"""". So I bought a .44 magnum it was solid steel cast. And in the blessed name of Elvis well I just let it blast. 'Til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet. And they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace. Judge said """"What you got in your defense son?"""". """"Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on"""". I can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone. Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on...."""
1020,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Tonight my bag is packed. Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks. That will lead me across the border. Tomorrow my love and I Will sleep 'neath auburn skies. Somewhere across the border. We'll leave behind my dear. The pain and sadness we found here. And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy water. Where the sky grows grey and wide. We'll meet on the other side. There across the border. For you I'll build a house. High upon a grassy hill. Somewhere across the border. Where pain and memory. Pain and memory have been stilled. There across the border. And sweet blossoms fill the air. Pastures of gold and green. Roll down into cool clear waters. And in your arms 'neath open skies. I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes. There across the border. Tonight we'll sing the songs. I'll dream of you my coraz_n. And tomorrow my heart will be strong. And may the saints' blessing and grace. Carry me safely into your arms. There across the border. For what are we. Without hope in our hearts. That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters. And eat the fruit from the vine. I know love and fortune will be mine. Somewhere across the border.
1021,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,In the summer that I was baptized my father held me to his side. As they put me to the water he said how on that day I cried. We were prisoners of love a love in chains. He was standin' in the door I was standin' in the rain. With the same hot blood burning in our veins. Adam raised a Cain. All of the old faces ask you why you're back. They fit you with position and the keys to your daddy's Cadillac. In the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name. You remember the faces the places the names. You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain. Adam raised a Cain. In the Bible Cain slew Abel and East of Eden he was cast. You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past. Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain. Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame. You inherit the sins you inherit the flames. Adam raised a Cain. Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream. Adam raised a Cain.

1026,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,He lay his blanket underneath the freeway. As the evening sky grew dark. Took a sniff of toncho from his cocaine. And headed thru Balboa Park. Where the men in their Mercedes. Come nightly to employ. In the cool San Diego evening. The services of the border boys. He grew up near the Zona Norte. With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with. He swallowed their balloons of cocaine. Brought them across to the 12th streetstrip. Sleepin' in a shelter. If the night got to cold. Runnin' from the migra. Of the border patrol. Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks. And in thru the storm drain. They stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway. And each one took a name. There was X-man and Cochise. Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud. They come north to California. End up with the poison in their blood. He did what he had to for the money. Sometimes he sent home what he could spare. The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho. And jeans like the gavachos wear. One night the border patrol swept 12th Street. A big car came fast down the Boulevard. Spider stood caught in its headlights. Got hit and went down hard. As the car sped away=20. Spider held his stomachLimped to his blanket 'neath the freeway. Lay there tasting his own blood on his tongue. Closed his eyes and listened to he cars. Rushin' by so fast.
1027,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Your scrapbook's filled with pictures of all your leading men. Well baby don't put my picture in there with them. Don't make us some little girls dream that can't ever come true. That only serves to hurt us and make you cry like you do. Well baby don't do it to me and I won't do it to you. You've seen all the romantic movies you dream you take the boys home. But when the action fades your left all alone. You deserve better than this little girl can't you see you do. Do you need somebody to prove it to you?. Well baby you prove it to me and I'll prove it to you.. Now every night you go out looking for true lust satisfaction. But in the morning you end up with second thoughts that came from your. actions. And another cameo roll with some big player your befriending. Your gonna go broken hearted looking for that happy ending. Well girl your gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold. Crying alone in the theater as the credits roll. You see I won't be like those other guys. Who filled your head with pretty lies. And dreams that can never come true. Well listen. Baby you be true to me and I'll be true to you. So how about it?. Is it a deal?.
1028,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Take me now baby here as I am. Pull me close try an understand. I work all day out in the hot sun. Stay with me now till the mornin' comes. Come on now try and understand. The way I feel when I'm in your hands. Take me now as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. What I got I have earned. What I'm not I have learned. Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe. Just stay in my bed till the morning comes. Come on now try and understand. The way I feel when I'm in your hands. Take me now as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. Because the night.... Your love is here and now. The vicious circle turns and burns without. Though I cannot live forgive me now. The time has come to take this moment and. They can't hurt you now. Because the night....
1029,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I'm standing in the backyard. Listening to the party Inside. Tonight I'm drinkin' in the forgiveness. This life provides. The scars we carry remain but the pain slips away it seems. Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams. I'm watchin' you through the window. With your girlfriends from back home. You 're showin' off your dress. There's laughter and a toast. From your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen. Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams. In the darkness my fingers slip across your skin. I feel your sweet reply. The room fades away and suddenly I'm way up high. Just holdin' you to me. As through the window the moonlight streams. Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams. Now the ritual begins. 'Neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers. The dance floor is alive with beauty. Mystery and danger. We dance out 'neath the stars' ancient light into the darkening trees. Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams.
1030,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS. AS THE BAND PLAYS. WHAT ARE THOSE WORDS WHISPERED BABY. JUST AS YOU TURN AWAY. I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT. OUT ON THE EDGE OF TOWN. I WANNA READ YOUR MIND. TO KNOW JUST WHAT I´VE GOT IN. THIS NEW THING I´VE FOUND. SO TELL ME WHAT I SEE. WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES. IS THAT YOU BABY. OR JUST A BRILLIANT DISGUISE. I HEARD SOMEBODY CALL YOUR NAME. FROM UNDERNEATH OUR WILLOW. I SAW SOMETHING TUCKED IN SHAME. UNDERNEATH YOUR PILLOW. WELL I´VE TRIED SO HARD BABY. BUT I JUST CAN´T SEE. WHAT A WOMAN LIKE YOU. IS DOING WITH ME. SO TELL ME WHO I SEE. WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES. IS THAT YOU BABY. OR JUST A BRILLIANT DISGUISE. NOW LOOK AT ME BABY. STRUGGLING TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT. AND WHEN IT ALL FALLS APART.

I´M LOST IN THE DARKNESS OF OUR LOVE. GOD HAVE MERCY ON THE MAN. WHO DOUBTS WHAT HE´S SURE OF..
1031,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road. He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code. When something caught his eye he'd measure his need. And then very carefully he'd proceed. Billy met a young girl in the early days of May. It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away. In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim. He'd lay back in her arms and laugh what had happened to him. On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear. And in which hand he held his fate was never clear. Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride. And with own hands built a great house down by the riverside. Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right. He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights. Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray. For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay. One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name. She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep a thousand miles away. He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode. When he got there he didn't find nothing but road. Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name. Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain. At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white. Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light.
1032,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,They're still racing at the Trestles. But that blood it never burned in her veins. Now I hear she's got a house up in Fairview. And a style she's trying to maintain. Well if she wants to see me. You can tell her that I'm easily found. Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge. And tell here there's a. Darkness on the edge of town. Everybody's got a secret Sonny. Something that they just can't face. Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it. They carry it with them every step that they take. Till some day they just cut it loose. Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down. Where no one asks any questions. Or looks too long in your face. In the darkness on the edge of town. Some folks are born into a good life. Other folks get it anyway anyhow. I lost my money and I lost my wife. Then things don't seem to matter much to me now. Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop. I'll be on that hill with everything I got. Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost. I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost. For wanting things that can only be found. In the darkness on the edge of town
1033,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Driving in to Darlington County. Me and Wayne on the Fourth of July. Driving in to Darlington County. Looking for some work on the county line. We drove down from New York City. Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name. Driving in to Darlington City. Got a union connection with an uncle of Wayne's. We drove eight hundred miles without seeing a cop. We got rock and roll music blasting off the T-top singing. CHORUS:. Sha la la. La la la la la la. Sha la la. La la la la. Hey little girl standing on the corner. Today's your lucky day for sure all right. Me and my buddy we're from New York City. We got two hundred dollars we want to rock all night. Girl you're looking at two big spenders. Why the world don't know what me and Wayne might do. Our pa's each own one of the World Trade Centers. For a kiss and a smile I'll give mine all to you. Come on baby take a seat on my fender. It's a long night and tell me what else were you gonna do. Just me and you we could. CHORUS:. Sha la la. La la la la la la. Sha la la. La la la la. Little girl sitting in the window. Ain't seen my buddy in seven days. County man tells me the same thing. He don't work and he don't get paid. Little girl you're so young and pretty. Walk with me and you can have your way. And we'll leave this Darlinton City. For a ride down the Dixie Highway. Driving out of Darlington County. Me eyes seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. Driving out of Darlington County. Seen Wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state trooper's Ford. CHORUS:. Sha la la. La la la la la la. Sha la la. La la la la.
1034,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,There's a pale horse coming. And I'm going to ride it. I'll rise in the morning. My fate decided. I'm a dead man walking. I'm a dead man walking. In St James' Parish I was born and christened. I've got my story Mister. Ain't no need for you to listen. It's just a dead man talking. Once I had a job I had a a girl. Between our dreams and actions lies this world. In the deep forest their blood and tears rushed over me. All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun. And my fear up inside of me. Like a dead man talkin'. 'Neath the summer sky my eyes went black. Sister I won't ask for forgiveness. My sins are all I have. Now the clouds above my prisonMove slowly across the sky. There's a new day. coming and my dreams are full to-night.
1035,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I threw my robe on in the morning. Watched the ring on the stove turn red. Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee. Pulled on my boots and made the bed. Screen door hangin' off its hinges. Kept bangin' me awake all night. As I look out the window. The only thing in site. Is dry lightning on the horizon line. Just dry lightning and and you on my mind. I chased the heat of her blood. Like it was the holy grail. Descend beautiful spirit. Into the evening pale. Her appaloosa's. Kickin' in the corral smelling rain. There's a low thunder rolling'Cross the mesquite plain. But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line. It's just dry lightning and and you on my mind. I'd drive down to Alvarado Street. Where she'd dance to make ends meet. I'd spend the night over my gin. As she'd talk to her men. Well the piss yellow sun. Comes bringin' up the day. She said 'Ain't nobody can give nobody. What they really need anyway.'. Well you get so sick of the fightin'. You lose your fear of the end. But I can't lose your memory. And the sweet smell of your skin. And it's just dry lightning on the horizonline. Just dry lightning and and you on my mind.
1036,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,They caught Bobby by Lakefoot Road. Saying how the story gets told. (?). (?). (2nd verse unintelligible). e. Everybody's looking for somebody. Everybody's looking. Everybody's looking. Everybody's looking for somebody.
1037,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Sunday matinee. In a one dog town. You're two seats away. I move two seats down. Wipe the tears from your eyes. The first kiss i stole. I walk you home. The credits roll. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. I hear my voice. On the telephone. But I'm just running. The same old business. I feel like I'm off. Somewhere so alone. Just watching us both. Running the distance. Watching us both. Slowly pull back. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. I come home. Clothes all over the place. You're crying in the corner. Makeup running down your face. Your case is packed. The fight starts. I (?????) cursin'. Baby is this the scene. Which we been rehearsin'. Is this the one. Or have i lost track. Waitin' for us. To fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. A face wet with shame. Eyes filled with hurt. I scream out your name. You rip my shirt. A small bungalow. A late afternoon. The sunlight falls. Like a bright veil. A camera pans. An empty room. The picture dissolves. Slowly pulls back. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. . . . .
1038,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I was your big man I was your prince charming. King on a white horse hey now look how far I've fallen. I tried to trick you yeah but baby you got wise. You cut me cut me right down to size. Now I'm just a fool in Gloria's eyes. Swore I'd get you back I was so sure. I'd get you back like I done so many times before. A little sweet talk to cover over all of the lies. You came runnin' back but to my surprise. Well there was somethin' gone in Gloria's eyes. Well in the dark when it was just me and you. I asked the question that I knew the answer to. Is that a smile my little dolly on the shelf. Tell me is that a smile. Of is it something else?. Now I work hard to prove my love is true. Now I work hard and I bring it on home to you. At night I pray as silently you lie. Some day my love again will rise. Like a shining torch in Gloria's eyes. I was your big man your prince charming. King on a white horse now look how far I've fallen.
1039,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade. I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade. I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch. I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Sit down' I stood up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing. I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could. sing. I pushed B-52 and bombed `em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on. standing. I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to. landing. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Come down' I threw. up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard. to hold your breath. I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared. I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress. Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little. place in the stars. I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said`Sit down'I stood up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. Ooh-ooh growin' up.
1040,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,They're the Hollywood kids each and every one. With a high class smile and a little baby's tongue. Lonely hard head losers dressed in the tinsel of the times. And learn all the latest lines and the order in which they come. So perfumed sweet and so obscene. Like the fancy dancers of our dirty green. Oh they knew hello and good bye but not what goes in between. Yea and its such a scene on Saturday night. Fifth avenue freaks strait off the racks. They swear you can buy and sell your soul on a good dat outside. They're the Hollywood kids each and everyone. And on Sunday back into their holes they run. And on Monday here I stand alone on this littered stage like an animal who. forgot he was in a cage. Just a restless soul. Just waiting for 'em to come. They're Hollywood kids each and everyone.
1041,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,The guilty undertaker sighs. The lonesome organ grinder cries. The silver saxophone says. I should refuse you. The cracked bells and washed out horns. Blow into my face with scorn. But it's not that way. I wasn't born to lose you. I want you I want you. I want you so bad. Honey I want you. The drunken politician leaps. Upon the streets where mothers weep. And the saviors who are fast asleep. They wait for you. And I wait for them to interrupt. Me drinking from my broken cup. And ask me to open up. The gate for you. Now all my fathers. They've gone down. True love. They've been without it. But all their daughters. Put me down. 'Cause I don't. Think about it. Well I return to the queen of spades. And talk with my chamber maid. She knows that I'm not afraid to. Look at her. She is good to me and there's. Nothing she doesn't see. She knows where I'd like to be. But it doesn't matter. Now your dancing child with the chinese suit. He spoke to me I took his flute. No I wasn't very cute to him. Was I. But I did it because he lied. Because he took you for a ride. And because time was on his side. And because I. Want you I want you. I want you so bad. Honey I want you.
1042,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Hey little girl is your daddy home. Did he go away and leave you all alone. I got a bad desire. I'm on fire. Tell me now baby is he good to you. Can he do to you the things that I do. I can take you higher. I'm on fire. Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby. edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley. through the middle of my soul. At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet. and a freight train running through the. middle of my head. Only you can cool my desire. I'm on fire.
1043,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,We said we'd walk together baby come what may. That come the twilight should we lose our way. If as we're walkin a hand should slip free. I'll wait for you. And should I fall behind. Wait for me. We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side. We'd help each other stay in stride. But each lover's steps fall so differently. But I'll wait for you. And if I should fall behind. Wait for me. Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true. But you and I know what this world can do. So let's make our steps clear that the other may see. And I'll wait for you. If I should fall behind. Wait for me. Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead. There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed. Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees. I'll wait for you. And should I fall behind. Wait for me. Darlin' I'll wait for you. Should I fall behind. Wait for me.
1044,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late. Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now. I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate. We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow. `Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us. There's a darkness in this town that's got us too. But they can't touch me now and you can't touch me now. They ain't gonna do to me what I watched them do to you. So say goodbye it's Independence Day. It's Independence Day all down the line. Just say goodbye it's Independence Day. It's Independence Day this time. Now I don't know what it always was with us. We chose the words and yeah we drew the lines. There was just no way this house could hold the two of us. I guess that we were just too much of the same kind. Well say goodbye it's Independence Day. All boys must run away come Independence Day. So say goodbye it's Independence Day. All men must make their way come Independence Day. Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint. And the highway she's deserted down to Breaker's Point. There's a lot of people leaving town now. Leaving their friends their homes. At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone. Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late. Nothing we can say can change anything now. Because there's just different people coming down here now. And they see things in different ways. And soon everything we've known will just be swept away. So say goodbye it's Independence Day. Papa now I know the things you wanted that you could not say. But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day. I swear I never meant to take those things away.
1045,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra. I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova. I could walk like Brando right into the sun. Then dance just like a Casanova. With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet. Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat. When I strut down the street I could feel its heartbeat. The sisters fell back and said """"Don't that man look pretty"""". The cripple on the corner cried out """"Nickels for your pity"""". Them downtown boys sure talk gritty. It's so hard to be a saint in the city. I was the king of the alley I could talk some trash. I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash. I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool. A backstreet gambler with the luck to lose. And when the heat came down it was left on the ground. The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street. Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat. I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat. It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy. And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead. As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead. They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread. But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat. You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat. Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet. Then you're outa that hole and back up on the street. And them South Side sisters sure look pretty. The cripple on the corner cries out """"Nickels for your pity"""". And them downtown boys sure talk gritty. It's so hard to be a saint in the city."""
1046,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Driving home she grabs something to eat. Turns a corner and drives down her street. Into a row of houses she just melts away. Like the scenery in another man's play. Into a house where the blinds are closed. To keep from seeing things she don't wanna know. She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street. The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat. In the Jackson Cage. Down in Jackson Cage. You can try with all your might. But you're reminded every night. That you been judged and handed life. Down in Jackson Cage. Every day ends in wasted motion. Just crossed swords on the killing floor. To settle back is to settle without knowing. The hard edge that you're settling for. Because there's always just one more day. And it's always gonna be that way. Little girl you've been down here so long. I can tell by the way that you move you belong to. The Jackson Cage. Down in Jackson Cage. And it don't matter just what you say. Are you tough enough to play the game they play. Or will you just do your time and fade away. Down into the Jackson Cage. Baby there's nights when I dream of a better world. But I wake up so downhearted girl. I see you feeling so tired and confused. I wonder what it's worth to me or you. Just waiting to see some sun. Never knowing if that day will ever come. Left alone standing out on the street. Till you become the hand that turns the key down in. Jackson Cage. Down in Jackson Cage. Well darlin' can you understand. The way that they will turn a man. Into a stranger to waste away. Down in the Jackson Cage.

1048,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month. Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none. He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine. He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99. Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop.

Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away. Now judge I had debts no honest man could pay. The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away. Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man. But it was more `n all this that put that gun in my hand. Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead. So if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head. Then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time. And let `em shave off my hair and put me on that killin' line."""

1050,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Well now on a summer night in a dusky room. Come a little piece of the Lord's undying light. Crying like he swallowed the fiery moon. In his mother's arms it was all the beauty I could take. Like the missing words to some prayer that I could never make. In a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused. Searching for a little bit of God's mercy. I found living proof. I put my heart and soul I put 'em high upon a shelf. Right next to the faith the faith that I'd lost in myself. I went down into the desert city. Just tryin' so hard to shed my skin. I crawled deep into some kind of darkness. Lookin' to burn out every trace of who I'd been. You do some sad sad things baby. When it's your you 're tryin' to lose. You do some sad and hurtful things. I've seen living proof. You shot through my anger and rage. To show me my prison was just an open cage. There were no keys no guards. Just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars. Well now all that's sure on the boulevard. Is that life is just a house of cards. As fragile as each and every breath. Of this boy sleepin' in our bed. Tonight let's lie beneath the eaves. Just a close band of happy thieves. And when that train comes we'll get on board. And steal what we can from the treasures of the Lord. It's been along long drought baby. Tonight the rain's pourin' down on our roof. Looking for a little bit of God's mercy. I found living proof.
1051,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I was there. When you needed someone. Look now baby. And see what we have undone. Oh I did most of the talking. But you were the one who lied. Bye bye baby. Out love is tumbling down. I can't be hanging around. Love on the wrong side of town. Oh baby. You were gone. When I needed you by my side. There was no one. To dry the tears from my eyes. Oh you were the one who cheated. But I was the one who cried. Bye bye baby. Out love is tumbling down. I can't be hanging around. Love on the wrong side of town. Bye bye baby. Out love is tumbling down. I can't be hanging around. Love on the wrong side of town. Bye bye baby. Love on the wrong side of town. Bye bye baby. Bye bye darling. Bye bye baby.
1052,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,House got too crowded clothes got too tight. And I don't know just where I'm going tonight. Out where the sky's been cleared by a good hard rain. There's somebody callin' my secret name. I'm going down to Lucky Town. Going down to Lucky Town. I wanna lose these blues I've found. Down in Lucky Town. Down in Lucky Town. Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots. But that coat always had a tread hangin' loose. Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise. It led me right past your house and on over the rise. I'm going down to Lucky Town. Down to Lucky Town. I'm gonna lose these blues I've found. Down in Lucky Town. Down in Lucky Town. I had some victory that was just failure in deceit. Now the joke's comin' up through the soles of my feet. I been a long time walking on fortune's cane. Tonight I'm steppin' lightly and feelin' no pain. Well here's to your good looks baby now here's to my health. Here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves. When it comes to luck you make your own. Tonight I got dirt on my hands but I'm building me a new home. Down in Lucky Town. Down in Lucky Town. I'm gonna lose these blues I've found. Down in Lucky Town.
1053,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Magic. I got a coin in my palm. I can make it disappear. I got a card up my sleeve. Name it and I’ll pull it out your ear. I got a rabbit in my hat. If you wanna come and see. This is what we’ll be. This is what we’ll be. . I got shackles on my wrists. Soon I’ll slip and I’ll be gone. Chain me in a box in the river. And Rising in the Sun. Trust none of what you hear. And less of what you see. This is what we’ll be. This is what we’ll be. I got a shiny saw blade. All I need’s a volunteer. I’ll cut you in half. While your smilin’ at me. And the freedom that your songs. Drifting like a ghost amongst the trees. This is what we’ll be. This is what we’ll be. Now there’s a fire down below. But it’s coming up here. So leave everything you know. Carry only what you feel. On the road the sun is sinkin’ low. Sombody’s hanging in the trees. This is what we’ll be. This is what we’ll be
1054,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Well you can go out with him. Play with all of his toys. But takin' care of you darlin'. Ain't for one of the boys. Oh there's somethin' in your soul. That he's gonna rob. And lovin' you baby lovin' you darlin'. Lovin' you woman is a man's man's job. Lovin' you's a man's job baby. Lovin' you's a man's job. Lovin' you's a man's job baby. Lovin' you's a man's job.

Now if you're lookin' for a hero. Someone to save the day. Well darlin' my feet. They're made of clay. But I've got something in my soul. And I wanna give it up. But gettin' up the nerve. Gettin' up the nerve. Gettin' up the nerve is a man's man's job. Lovin' you's a man's job baby. Lovin' you's a man's job. Lovin' you's a man's job woman. Lovin' you's a man's job.
1055,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Well I sought gold and diamond rings. My own drug to ease the pain that living brings. Walked from the mountain to the valley floor. Searching for my beautiful reward. Searching for my beautiful reward. From a house on a hill a sacred light shines. I walk through these rooms but none of them are mine. Down empty hallways I went from door to door. Searching for my beautiful reward. Searching for my beautiful reward. Well your hair shone in the sun. I was so high I was the lucky one. Then I came crashing down like a drunk on a barroom floor. Searching for my beautiful reward. Searching for my beautiful reward. Tonight I can feel the cold wind at my back. I'm flyin' high over gray fields my feathers long and black. Down along the river's silent edge I soar. Searching for my beautiful reward. Searching for my beautiful reward.
1056,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,In the room where fortune falls. On a day when chance is all. In the dark of this exile. I felt the grace of your smile. Honey you're my lucky day. Baby you're my lucky day. When I've lost all the other bets I've made. Honey you're my lucky day. I've seen strong hearts give way. To the burdens of the day. To the weary hands of time. Where fortune is not kind. Honey you're my lucky day. Baby you're my lucky day. When I've lost all the other bets I've made. Honey you're my lucky day. I have waited at your side. I've counted the tears you've cried. But to win darling we must pay. So don't hide your heart away. Honey you're my lucky day. Baby you're my lucky day. When I've lost all the other bets I've made. Honey you're my lucky day

1058,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I saw her stangin' on her front lawn. Just twirlin' her baton. Me and her went for a ride sir. And ten innocent people died. From the town of Lincoln Nebraska. Aith a sawed-off .410 on my lap. Through to the badlands of Wyoming. I killed everything in my path. I can't say that I'm sorry. For the things that we done. At least for a little while sir. Me and her we had us some fun. The jury brought in a guilty verdict. And the judge he sentenced me to death. Midnight in prision storeroom. With leather straps across my chest. Sheriff when the man pulls. That switch sir and snaps my poor neck back. You make sure my pretty baby. Is sittin' right there on my lap. They declared me unfit to live. Said into that great void my soul'd be hurled. They wanted to know why I did what I did. Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world.
1059,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,We busted out of class had to get away from those fools. We learned more from a three-minute record. That we ever learned in school. Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound. I can feel my heart begin to pound. You say you're tired and you just want to close. Your eyes and follow your dreams down. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrender. Now young faces grow sad and old and hearts. of fire grow cold. We swore blood brothers against the wind. I'm ready to grow young again. And hear yur sister's voice calling us home. Acroos the open yards. Believin' we could cut someplace of our own. With these drums and these guitars. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrender. Blood brother in the stormy night with a vow to defend. No retreat no surrender. Now on the street tonight the lights gro dim. The walls of my room are closing in. But it's good to see your smiling face. And to hear your voice again. We could sleep in the twilight. By the river bed. With a wide open country in our hearts. And these romantic dreams in our heads. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrende
1060,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Woke up this morning my house was cold. Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'. Went out and hoped in my old Ford. Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'. We've given each other some hard lessons lately. But we ain't learnin'. We're the same sad story that's a fact. One step up and two steps back. Bird on a wire outside my motel room. But he ain't singin'. Girl in white outside a church in June. But the church bells they ain't ringing. I'm sitting here in this bar tonight. But all I'm thinkin' is. I'm the same old story same old act. One step up and two steps back. It's the same thing night on night. Who's wrong baby who's right. Another fight and I slam the door on. Another battle in our dirty little war. When I look at myself I don't see. The man I wanted to be. Somewhere along the line I slipped off track. I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back. There's a girl across the bar. I get the message she's sending. Mmm she ain't lookin' to married. And me well honey I'm pretending. Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms. The music was never-ending. We danced as the evening sky faded to black. One step up and two steps back
1061,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Pony boy pony boy. Won't you be my pony boy. Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up whoo. My pony boy. Ride with me ride with me. Won't you take a ride with me. Underneath the starry sky. My pony boy. O'er the hills and through the trees. We'll go ridin' you and me. Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-away. My pony boy. Down into the valley deep. 'Neath the eaves we will sleep. Sky of dreams up above. My pony boy.
1062,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,And the Black man releases his Caddilac fangs. And your chech died in bed as the landlord thanks the young girl next door. for the rent. Where telegraph wires are atached to your mind. Delinquent daughters to their mothers still lie. Papa stands on the corner ???waitin to beat the drum???. Welcome Home My Prodigal Son. When the telephone rings and falls of the hook. And your legs have been stolen by some defense department crook. And you startin' to think about writing a book. But now you won't pledge allingence to anything. And the maid comes in with coffee and cake. In a low-cut dress she wore just for your sake. You explain your not dead and she takes it as a compliment. and sticks out her tounge and asks for requests. In a land were skyscrapers scrapes the sky. and delinquent daughters to their mothers still lie. Papa stands on the corner ???waitin' to beat the drum???. Welcome Home My Prodigal Son
1063,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396. Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor. She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot. Outside the Seven-Eleven store. Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch. And he rides with me from town to town. We only run for the money got no strings attatched. We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down. Tonight tonight the strip's just right. I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat. Summer's here and the time is right. We're goin' racin' in the street. We take all the action we can meet. And we cover all the northeast state. When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street. From the fire roads to the interstate. Some guys they just give up living. And start dying little by little piece by piece. Some guys come home from work and wash up. Then go rain' in the street. Tonight tonight the strip's just right. I wanna blow 'em all out of their seats. Calling out around the world. We're going racin' in the street. I met her on the strip three years ago. In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.. I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away. But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes. And she cries herself to sleep at night. When I come home the house is dark. She sighs """"Baby did you make it all right"""". She sits on the porch of her daddy's house. But all her pretty dreams are torn. She stares off alone into the night. With the eyes of one who hates for just being born. For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels. Rumbling through this promised land. Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea. And wash these sins off our hands. Tonight tonight the highway's bright. Out of our way mister you best keep. 'Cause summer's here and the time is right. We're goin' racin' in the street."""

1065,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Took my baby to a picture show. Found a seat in the back row. Sound came up lights went down. Rambo he was blowin' 'em down. I don't need no gun in my fist baby. All I need is your sweet kiss. To get me feelin' like a real man. Feelin' like a real man. Well you can beat on your chest. Hell any monkey can. But you got me feelin' like a real man. Oh feelin' like a real man. Me and my girl Saturday night. Late movie on channel five. The girls were droppin' they're droppin' like flies. To some smooth talkin' cool walkin' private eye. I ain't got no nerves of steel. But all I got to know is if your love is real. To get me feelin' like a real man. Oh feelin' like a real man. Well you can beat.... I ain't no fighter that's easy to see. And as a lover I ain't goin' down in history. But when the lights go down and you pull me close. Well I look in your eyes and there's one thing I know. Baby I'll be tough enough. If I can find the guts to give you all my love. Then I'll be feelin' like a real man. Oh feelin' like a real man. Well you can beat....

In a whitewash shotgun shack an old man passes away. Take his body to the graveyard and over him they pray. Lord won't you tell us tell us what does it mean. Still at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe. Congregation gathers down by the riverside. Preacher stands with his Bible groom stands waitin' for his bride. Congregation gone and the sun sets behind a weepin' willow tree. Groom stands alone and watches the river rush on so effortlessly. Lord and he's wonderin' where can his baby be.

1067,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Remember when the music. Came from wooden boxes. Strung with silver wires. And as we sang. The words would set our hearts on fire. To believe in things. So we'd sing. Remember when the music. Brought us all together. To stand inside the rain. And as we'd join hands. We'd meet in the refrain. With dreams to live. And hope to give. Remember when the music. Was the best that we'd dream of. For our's children's time. And as we'd worked we'd sing. Cause we knew time. Was just a lie. A gift to say. A gift that future gave. Remember when the music. Was a rock we could cling to. So we would not despair. And as we sang we'd knew. We'd hear an echo in the air. And if we weren't smiling then. We'd smile again. And all the times I listened. And all the times I heard. And all the melodies I'm missing. And all the magic words. All the beautiful words. All the beautiful voices. And all the choices we had thenI hope you find you got. Those kind of choices once again. Remember when the music. Brought the night. Across the valley. And as we hum the melody. We'd be safe within the sound. So we'd sleep. To awake with dreams. And promises to keep.

But they said """"Sorry son it's gone gone gone"""". Well there's men hunkered down by the railroad tracks. The Elkhorn Special blowin' my hair back. Tents pitched on the highway in the dirty moonlight. And I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight. Parked in the lumberyard freezin' our asses off. My kids in the back seat got a graveyard cough. Well I'm sleepin' up in front with my wife. Billy club tappin' on the windshield in the middle of the night. Says """"Move along man move along"""". Well big limousine long shiny and black. You don't look ahead you don't look back. How many times can you get up after you've been hit?. Well I swear if I could spare the spit. I'd lay one on your shiny chrome. And send you on your way back home. So if you're gonna leave your town where the north wind blow. To go on down where that sweet soda river flow. Well you better think twice on it Jack. You're better off buyin' a shotgun dead off the rack. You ain't gonna find nothin' down here friend. Except seeds blowin' up the highway in the south wind.

1070,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""Miguel came from a small town in northern Mexico. He came north with his brother Luis to California three years ago. They crossed at the river Levee when Luis was just 16. And found work together in the fields of the San Joaquin. They left their friends and family. Their father said """"My sons one thing you will learn. For everything the north gives it exacts a price in return.. """"They worked side by side in the orchards. From morning till the day was thru. Doing the work the hueros wouldn't. Word was out some men in from Sinaloa were looking for some hands. Well deep in Fresno county there was a deserted chicken ranch. There was a small tin shack on the edge of a ravine. Miguel and Luis stood cooking methamphetamine. You could spend a year in the orchards. Or make half as much in one ten-hour shift. Working for the men from Sinaloa. But if you slipped the Hydriodic acid. Could burn right thru your skin. They'd leave you spittin' up blood in the desert. If you breathed those fumes in. It was early one winter evening as Miguel stood watch outside. When the shack exploded lighting up the valley night. Miguel carried Luis' body over his shoulder down a swale. To the creekside and there in the tall grass Luis Rosales died. Miguel lifted Luis' body into his truck and then he drove. To where the morning sunlight fell on a eucalyptus grove. There in the dirt he dug up 10000 dollars all that they'd saved. Kissed his brother's lips and placed him in his grave."""

Now Raphael Rodriguez was just seven years old. Shot down in a schoolyard by some East Compton Cholos. His mamma cried """"My beautiful boy is dead"""". In the hills the self-made men just sighed and shook their heads. This is a prayer for the souls of the departed. Those who've gone and left their babies brokenhearted. Young lives over before they got started. This is a prayer for the souls of the departed. Tonight as I tuck my own son in bed. All I can think of is what if it would've been him instead. I want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down. Right here on my own piece of dirty ground. Now I ply my trade in the land of king dollar. Where you get paid and your silence passes as honor. And all the hatred and dirty little lies. Been written off the books and into decent men's eyes."""

Jane moved in with here ma out on Shawnee Lake. She sighed ma sometimes my whole life feels like one big mistake. She settled in in a back room time passed on. Later that winter a son came along. Spare parts and broken hearts. Keep the world turnin' around. Now Janey walked that baby across the floor night after night. But she was a young girl and she missed the party lights. Meanwhile in South Texas in a dirty oil patch. Bobby heard about his son bein' born and swore he wasn't ever goin' back. Spare parts and broken hearts. Keep the world turnin' around. Janey heard about a woman over in Calverton. Put her baby in the river let the river roll on. She looked at her boy in the crib where he lay. Got down on her knees cried till she prayed. Mist was on the water low run the tide. Janey held her son down at the riverside. Waist deep in water how bright the sun shone. She lifted him in her arms and carried him home. As he lay sleeping in her bed Janey took a look around at everything. Went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring. Took out her wedding dress tied that ring up in its sash. Went straight down to the pawn shop man and walked out with some good. cold cash. Spare parts and broken hearts. Keep the world turnin' around.
1075,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,In the tall grass we held hands. Down by the river we made plans. Of what would and would not be. It was impossible to see. Their black boots shone in the sun. They were waiting on the Annandale train. when my baby come. Little girl with the long black hair. Do you know what lies 'neath the long coats that they wear. Once I swore you'd ride with me. (to some far and distant shore). Down where this river meets the sea. (I'll make you mine forevermore). Over these dark hills I'd walk along. (just to hold you in my arms). To lie with you on a bed of stone. River blood red with the years. You can flood this valley with a thousand tears. Wash away all that's been found. But you'll never wash away the sound. Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down. (stray bullet shot my baby down). Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down. (stray bullet shot my baby down). Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down. (stray bullet shot my baby down). Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down
1076,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I fell asleep on a dark and starlit sea. With nothing but the cloak of God's mercy over me. I come upon strange earth and a great black cave. I dreamt I awoke as if buried in my grave. We've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. Disappeared from this world. We've been swallowed up. The bones of sailors from the north and sailors from the east. Lay high in a pyre in the belly of a beast. A beast should you wander in its path upon your ship and your flesh he'll sup. You'll disappear from this world until you've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. Disappeared from this world. We've been swallowed up. We trusted our skills and our good sails. Our faith that with God the righteous in this world prevail. But we've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. Disappeared from this world. We've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. Disappeared from this world. We've been swallowed up
1077,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""Billy had a mistress down on 'A' and 12th. She was that little somethin' that he did for himself. His own little secret didn't hurt nobody. Come the afternoon he'd take her wadin'. Waist deep in the big muddy. Waist deep in the big muddy. You start out standing but end up crawlin'. Got in some trouble and needed a hand from a friend of mine. This old friend he had a figure in mind. It was nothing illegal just a little bit funny. He said """"C'mon don't tell me that the rich don't know. Sooner or later it all comes down to money"""". And you're waist deep in the big muddy. Waist deep in the big muddy. You start on higher ground but end up crawlin'. Well I had a friend said """"You watch what you do. Poison snake bites you and you're poison too""""*. How beautiful the river flows and the birds they sing. But you and I we're messier things. There ain't no one leavin' this world buddy. Without their shirttail dirty. Or their hands bloody. Waist deep in the big muddy. Waist deep in the big muddy. You start on higher ground but end up somehow crawlin'. Waist deep in the big muddy."""
1078,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""I got my discharge from Fort Irwin. Took a place on the San Diego county line. Felt funny bein' a civilian again. It'd be some time. My wife had died a year ago. I was still tryin' to find my way back whole. Went to work for the INS on the line. With the California border patrol. Bobby Ramirez was a ten year veteran. We became friends. His family was from. Guanajuato. So the job it was different for him. He said """"They risk death in the deserts and mountains. Pay all they got to the smugglers rings. We send 'em home and they come right back again. Carl hunger is a powerful thing."""". Well I was good at doin' what I was to. l'd Kept my uniform pressed and clean. At night I chased their shadows. Thru the arroyos and ravines. Drug runners farmers with their families. Young women with little children by their sides. Come night we'd wait out in the canyons. And try to keep 'em from crossin' the line. Well the first time that I saw her. She was in the holdin' pen. Our eyes met and she looked away. Then she looked back again. Her hair was black as coal. Her eyes reminded me of what I'd lost. She had a young child cryin' in her arms. I asked """"Senora is there anything I can do?"""". There's a bar in Tijuana. Where me and Bobby drink alongside. The same people we'd sent back the day before. She said her name was Louisa. She was from Sonora and had just come north. We danced and I held her in my arms. And I knew what I would do. She said she had some family in Madera county. If she her child and younger brother could just get thru. At night they come across the levee. In the searchlight's dusty glow. We'd rush 'em in our Broncos. Force 'em back down into the river below. She climbed into my truck. She leaned toward me and we kissed. As we drove her brother's shirt slipped open. And I saw the tape across his chest. We were just about on the highway. When Bobby's jeep come up in the dust on my right. I pulled over and let my engine run. And stepped out into his lights. I felt myself movin'. My gun restin' 'neath my hand. We stood there starin' at each other. As off thru the arroyo she ran. Bobby Ramirez he never said nothin'. 6 months later I left the line. I drifted to the central valley. And took what work I could find. At night I searched the local bars. And the migrant towns. Lookin' for my Louisa. With the black hair fallin' down."""
1079,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,The way she kisses so tenderly. The way she gives her love to me. I been felt by the graces and angels up above. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. That make me love her. The way she sighs when I hold her tight. Good times and bad will be alright. Faces on the street they push hard and they shove. Disappear with the little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. I know I love her. The soft summer breeze fills her every sigh. Her eyes are bluer than the summer sky. I been felt by the graces and angels up above. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. That make me love her. And when the night closes in. I'm drifting and I can't find a friend. On the wings of the angels I'm saved by her love. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. That make me love her. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does
1080,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,My soul went walkin' but I stayed here. Feel like I been workin' for a thousand years. Chippin' away at this chain of my own lies. Climbin' a wall a hundred thousand miles high. Well I woke up this morning on the other side. Yeah yeah this is the long goodbye. Hey yeah this is the long goodbye. Same old faces it's the same old town. What once was laughs is draggin' me now. Wailin' on rain hangin' on for love. Words of forgiveness from some God above. Ain't no words of mercy comin' from on high. Oh no just a long goodbye. Yeah yeah just one long goodbye. Well I went to leave twenty years ago. Since then I guess I been packin' kinda slow. Sure did like that admirin' touch. Guess I like'd it a little too much. The moon is high and here I am. Sittin' here with this hammer in hand. One more drink oughta ease the pain. Starin' at that last link in the chain. Well let's raise our glass and let this hammer fly. Hey yeah this is the long goodbye. Hey yeah this is the long goodbye.
1081,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,He rode the rails since the Great Depression. Fifty years out on the skids. He said 'You don't cross nobody. You'll be all right out here kid.'. Left my family in Pennsylvania. Searchin' for work I hit the road. I met Frank in East Texas. In a freight yard blown thru with snow. From New Mexico to Colorado California to the sea. Frank he showed me the ropes sir=20. Just till I could get back on my feet. I hoed sugar beets outside of Firebaugh I picked the peaches from the. Marysville trees. They bunked us in a barn just like animals. Me and a hundred others just like me. We split up come the springtime. I never seen Frank again. 'Cept one rainy night he blew by me on a grainer. Shouted my name and disappeared in the rain and wind. They found him shot dead outside of Stockton. His body lyin' on a muddy hill. Nothin' taken nothin' stolen. Somebody killin' just to kill. Late that summer was rollin' thru the plains of Texas. A vision passed before my eyes. A small house sittin' trackside. With the glow of the savior's beautiful light. A woman stood cookin' in the kitchen. Kid sat at a table with his old man. Now I wonder does my son miss me. Does he wonder where I am. Tonight I pick my campsite carefully. Outside the Sacramento yard. Gather some wood and light a fire. In the early winter dark. Wind whistling cold I pull my coat around me. Heat some coffee and stare out into the black night. I lie awake I lie awake sir. With my machete by my side. My Jesus your gracious love and mercy. Tonight I'm sorry could not fill my heart. Like one good rifle. And the name of who I ought to kill.
1082,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert. I pick up my money and head back into town. Driving cross the Waynesboro county line. I got the radio on and I'm just killing time. Working all day in my daddy's garage. Driving all night chasing some mirage. Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands. Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man. And I believe in a promised land. I've done my best to live the right way. I get up every morning and go to work each day. But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold. Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode. Explode and tear this town apart. Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart. Find somebody itching for something to start. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands. Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man. And I believe in a promised land. There's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor. I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm. Gonna be a twister to blow everything down. That ain't got the faith to stand its ground. Blow away the dreams that tear you apart. Blow away the dreams that break your heart. Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands. Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man. And I believe in a promised land.
1083,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Well I rode that ribbon highway. I saw above me the endless sky. I saw below me the golden valley. This land was made for you and me. I've roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps. Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts. And all around me a voice was calling. This land was made for you and me. This land is your land. This land is my land. From California. To the New York island. From the Redwood Forest. To the Gulf Stream waters. This land was made for you and me. Well the sun came shining and I was strolling. Through wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling. And a voice was sounding. As the fog was lifting. Saying this land was made for you and me. This land is your land. This land is my land. From California. To the New York island. From the Redwood Forest. To the Gulf Stream waters. This land was made for you and me.
1084,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Well It's Saturday night. you're all dressed up in blue. I been watching you awhile. maybe you been watching me too. So somebody ran out. left somebody's heart in a mess. Well if you're looking for love. honey I'm tougher than the rest. Some girls they want a handsome Dan. or some good-lookin' Joe on their arm. Some girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo. Well 'round here baby. I learned you get what you can get. So if you're rough enough for love. honey I'm tougher than the rest. The road is dark. and it's a thin thin line. But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time. Maybe your other boyfriends. couldn't pass the test. Well if you're rough and ready for love. honey I'm tougher than the rest. Well it ain't no secret. I've been around a time or two. Well I don't know baby maybe you've been around too. Well there's another dance. all you gotta do is say yes. And if you're rough and ready for love. honey I'm tougher than the rest. If you're rough enough for love. baby I'm tougher than the rest
1085,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Fat man sitting on a little stool. Takes the money from my hand while his eyes take a walk all over you. Hands me the ticket smiles and whispers good luck. Cuddle up angel cuddle up my little dove. We'll ride down baby into this tunnel of love. I can feel the soft silk of your blouse. And them soft thrills in our little fun house. Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us. You me and all that stuff we're so scared of. Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love. There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D. I'm laughing at you you're laughing at me. There's a room of shadows that gets so dark brother. It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love. it ought to be easy ought to be simple enough. Man meets woman and they fall in love. But the house is haunted and the ride gets rough. And you've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love.
1086,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I met a girl and we ran away. I swore I'd make her happy every day. And how I made her cry. Two faces have I. Sometimes mister I feel sunny and wild. Lord I love to see my baby smile. Then dark clouds come rolling by. Two faces have I. One that laughs one that cries. One says hello one says goodbye. One does things I don't understand. Makes me feel like half a man. At night I get down on my knees and pray. Our love will make that other man go away. But he'll never say goodbye. Two faces have I. Last night as I kissed you 'neath the willow tree. He swore he'd take your love away from me. He said our life was just a lie. And two faces have I. Well go ahead and let him try.
1087,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I went out walking the other day. Seen a little girl crying along the way. She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again. Someday your crying girl will end. And you'll find once again. Two hearts are better than one. Two hearts girl get the job done. Two hearts are better than one. Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes. But I was living in a world of childish dreams. Someday these childish dreams must end. To become a man and grow up to dream again. Now I believe in the end. Two hearts are better than one.... Sometimes it might seem like it was planned. For you to roam empty hearted through this land. Though the world turns you hard and cold. There's one thing mister that I know. That's if you think your heart is stone. And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone. Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind. That's why I'll keep searching till I find my special one. Two hearts are better than one....
1088,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark. I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart. It's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through. And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you. A friend of mine became a father last night. When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light. Of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines. And that great jukebox out on Route 39. They say he travels fastest who travels alone. But tonight I miss my girl mister tonight I miss my home. Is it the sound of the leaves. left blown by the wayside. That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight. Is it the cry of the river. With the moonlight shining through. That ain't what scares me baby. What scares me is losing you. They if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed. But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head. And God's light came shinin' on through. I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew. It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me. It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true. It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms. No no baby it was you. So hold me close honey say you're forever mine. And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine.
1089,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,I remember how rough your hand felt on mine on my wedding day. And the tears cried on my shoulder I couldn't turn away. Well so much has happened to me that I don't understand. All I can think of is being five years old following behind you at the beach tracing your footprints in the sand. Trying to walk like a man. By Our Lady Of The Roses we lived in the shadow of the elms. I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church whenever she heard those wedding bells. Well would they ever look so happy again the handsome groom and his bride. As they stepped into that long black limousine for their mystery ride. Well tonight you step away from me and alone at the alter I stand. And as I watch my bride coming down the aisle I pray for the strength to walk like a man. Well now the years have gone and I've grown from that seed you've sown. But I didn't think there'd be so many steps I'd have to learn on my own. Well I was young and I didn't know what to do. When I saw your best steps stolen away from you. Now I'll do what I can. I'll walk like a man. And I'll keep on walkin'.
1090,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""Put on my blue suede shoes. And I boarded the plane. Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues. In the middle of the pouring rain. W.C. Handy -- won't you look down over me. Yeah I got a first class ticket. But I'm as blue as a boy can be. Then I'm walking in Memphis. I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. Walking in Memphis. But do I really feel the way I feel. Saw the ghost of Elvis. On Union Avenue. Followed him up to the gates of Graceland. Then I watched him walk right through. Now security they did not see him. They just hovered 'round his tomb. But there's a pretty little thing. Waiting for the King. Down in the Jungle Room. Then I'm walking in Memphis. I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. Walking in Memphis. But do I really feel the way I feel. They've got catfish on the table. They've got gospel in the air. And Reverend Green be glad to see you. When you haven't got a prayer. But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis. Now Muriel plays piano. Every Friday at the Hollywood. And they brought me down to see her. And they asked me if I would --. Do a little number. And I sang with all my might. And she said --. """"Tell me are you a Christian child?"""". And I said """"Ma'am I am tonight"""". Then I'm walking in Memphis. I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. Walking in Memphis. But do I really feel the way I feel. Put on my blue suede shoes. And I boarded the plane. Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues. In the middle of the pouring rain. Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues. In the middle of the pouring rain"""
1091,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Well I've been walking through midnight. And there's no trace of dawn. I'm stuck in this moonlight. It's leading me on. My body's on fire. And I can't stand the pain. This burning desire. I feel once again. Now I'm fighting with madness. As I move down the street. Surrounded by sadness. I can't take this heat. The streetlamps are glowing. Like coals in the mist. Their lights keep me moving. I just can't resist. Now there's peace in this valley. But none in my mind. Like a drunk in an alley. I'm stumbling blind. With no destination. At an unholy speed. I must keep on moving. Try to walk off this need.
1092,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,Times were tough love was not enough. So you said sorry Johnny I'm gone gone gone. You said my act was funny. But we both knew what was missing honey. So you let out on your own. Now that pretty form that you've got baby. Will make sure you get along. But you're gonna find our someday honey. When You're alone you're alone. When You're alone you're alone. When You're alone you're alone. When You're alone you ain't nothing but alone. Now I was young and pretty on the mean streets of the city. And I fought to make'em my home. With just the shirt on my back I left and swore I'd never look back. And man I was gone gone gone. But there's things that'll knock you down you don't even see coming. And send you crawling like a baby back home. You're gonna find out that day sugar. When you're alone.... I knew some day your runnin' would be through. And you'd think back on me and you. And your love would be strong. You'd forget all the bad and think only of all the laughs that we had. And you'd wanna come home. Now it ain't hard feelings or nothin' sugar. That ain't what's got me singing this song. It's just nobody knows baby where love goes. But when it goes it's gone gone. When you're alone....
1093,Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"""Friday night's pay night guys fresh out of work. Talking about the weekend scrubbing off the dirt. Some heading home to their families. Some looking to get hurt. Some going down to Stovell wearing trouble on their shirts. I work for the county out of 95. All day I hold a red flag and watch the traffic pass me by. In my head I keep a picture of a pretty little miss. Someday mister I'm gonna lead a better life than this. CHORUS:. Working on the highway laying down the blacktop. Working on the highway all day long I don't stop. Working on the highway blasting through the bedrock. Working on the highway. Working on the highway. I met her at a dance down at the union hall. She was standing with her brothers back up against the wall. Sometimes we'd go walking down the union tracks. One day I looked straight at ther and she looked straight back. CHORUS:. Working on the highway laying down the blacktop. Working on the highway all day long I don't stop. Working on the highway blasting through the bedrock. Working on the highway. Working on the highway.

She don't know nothing about this cruel cruel world"""". We lit out down to Florida we got along all right. One day her brothers came and got her and. They took me in a black and white.

You can look but you better not no you better not no you better not touch. Well I came home from work and I switched on channel 5. There was a pretty little girly lookin' straight into my eyes. Well I watched as she wiggled back and forth across the screen. She didn't get me excited she just made me feel mean. You can look.... Well I called up Dirty Annie on the telephone.

Your own worst enemy has come to town. Yesterday the people were at ease. Baby slept in peace. You closed your eyes and saw her. You knew who you were. Now your own worst enemy has come to town. Your own worst enemy has come. Your world keeps turnin' 'round and 'round. But everything is upside down. Your own worst enemy has come to town. There's a face you know. Staring back from the shop window. The condition you're in. Now you just can't get out of this skin. The times they got too clear. So you removed all the mirrors. Once the family felt secure. Now no one's very sure. Your own worst enemy has come to town. Your own worst enemy has come. Everything is falling down. Your own worst enemy has come to town. Your own worst enemy has come. Everything is falling down. Your own worst enemy has come to town. Your flag it flew so high. It drifted into the sky

Do you remember baby last September. How you held me tight each and every night. Well whoops a daisy how you drove me crazy. Well I guess It Doesn't Matter Any More. There's no use me a crying. I've done every thing and now I'm sick of trying. I've thrown away my nights and wasted all my days. Over you. Now you go your way and I'll go mine. Now and forever till the end of time. I'll find somebody new and baby. We'll say we're through. And you Won't Matter Any More
1106,Buddy Holly,Rock,Last night as I watched the stars from my window. I pray Lord above to guide and protect you. Though I'm not wanted now. I still love you somehow. That is my only prayer - for you. Last night as I gazed through the mist in my eyes. I wanted you here to hold you so near. But silence tells me - you didn't hear my plea. I miss you so much since you left me. My heart ached apart since you left me. Though I'm not wanted now. I still love you somehow. That is my only prayer - for you
1107,Buddy Holly,Rock,Hearts that are broken and love that's untrue. These go with learning the game. When you love her and she doesn't love you. You're only learning the game. When she says that you're the only one she'll ever love. Then you find that you are not the one she's thinking of. Feeling so sad and you're all alone and blue. That's when you're learning the game. When she says that you're the only one she'll ever love. Then you find that you are not the one she's thinking of. Feeling so sad and you're all alone and blue. That's when you're learning the game. That's when you're learning the game
1108,Buddy Holly,Rock,You've left me alone with memories. I tried to endure you in this cheating. I loved you with my heart's every beating. Now my hopes are gone like wi-ind through the trees. 'cause you've left me alone with memories. I know that it may seem to you that i don't really care. But someday when you're all alone and memories are there. You'll know you've left me alone with memories. I tried forgetting what you meant to me. For now i realize that i'm alone. In my mind i really know that you are gone. But my foolish heart refuses to see. Why you've left me alone with memories. I know that it may seem to you that i don't really care. But someday when you're all alone and memories are there. You'll know you've left me alone with memories

1117,Buffalo Springfield,Rock,I don't tell no tales about no hot dusty roads. I'm a city boy and I stay at home. I make no excuses I just don't want to go. And I don't like being alone. I give you loving and a place to take off your shoes. It just surprise me for the case of the blues. It ainâ€™t no cloak you donâ€™t have to pay no dues. Just love me and I love you. And if you take some time. Being in line. I hate to stay looking inside. Of yourself. Just drop on by. Baby don't ask me why. At least you don't have to be by yourself. Just call mum likely I'll be there. Then you look around. Find a comfortable chair. And then you sit and you might think about. My hairs and I can't tell you why only where.

I fell in love the first time.. Kind woman. Won't you love me tonight. The look in your eyes. Kind woman. Don't leave me lonely tonight. Please say it's all right. Remember once before you're hearing. The old folks say. Love's an ageless old rhyme. But now a days you know the sayin' depends so much on. The kind of woman that you find. Kind woman.

The look in your eyes. Kind woman. Don't leave me lonely tonight. Please say it's all right.
1120,Buffalo Springfield,Rock,Upside down on a merry-go-round. Now just look at me. Spreading your eyes to see you standing for me. It's a lover you see. Not just to anyone. Not just to fee. Someone you can come maple leave. What in the world did you do. To make me love just you?. What did you do to me?. What you did to me. This time next time. Which ever let be. There's something I can't deny. I'm telling you now. Your love is something to me. It's like a sweet lullaby. A melody that could only imply. Loving you seems to me worth a try. What in the world did you do. To make me love just you?. What did you do to me?. What you did to me. What did you do to me?
1121,Buffalo Springfield,Rock,Pretty Girl Why. Stephen Stills. Like the ghost of someone dear. She comes to haunt me in my sleep. Still unable to sincerely. Give her heart away for keeps. Pretty Girl why?. Pretty girl why not love me?. Pretty girl why?. Pretty girl why?. There she leaves me twice as lonely. As I was but yesterday. Keeping such a hold upon my thoughts. So near yet far away. Pretty Girl why?. Pretty girl why not love me?. Pretty girl why?. Pretty girl why?. The minstrel boy has gone to war. Now burdened with his father's sword. Still she doesn't see how she can give him. Peace amidst the horror. Pretty Girl why?. Pretty girl why not love me?. Pretty girl why?. Pretty girl why?
1122,Buffalo Springfield,Rock,Soft winds blow in the summer time. Young lovers feel so free. Walkin’ hand and hand down a shady lane. What happen to me. What happen to me. Did you ever love a girl. Who walked right out on you. You should know just how I feel and. Why I’m so blue. Why I’m so blue. How can I forget those nights. When she kiss me soft and true. And whispered words only lovers know ooh. I love you. I love you. Well I made up my mind. I’ll find a new girl who love me tenderly. Forget the past I left behind now. To sad memories. To sad memories
1123,Buffalo Springfield,Rock,The end has come. The sky has lost it's sun. The harm is done. He was the only one. There goes my babe. There goes what might have been. There goes my babe. In the cool morning rain. And now my heart. Lies empty and still again. If he were here. I'd long to hold him near. But now it's clear. The price of love is dear. There goes my babe. There goes what might have been. There goes my babe. In the cool morning rain. And now my heart. Lies empty and still again
1124,Buffalo Springfield,Rock,Somebody's dreaming. Uno mundo. Fanciful scheming. Uno Mundo. Isn't he reading?. Uno mundo. Just the same. Uno mundo. Asia is breathing. Uno mundo. Africa's seething. Uno mundo. America bleating. Uno mundo. Just the same. Uno mundo. Uno mundo. Uno mundo. Uno mundo. Just the same. Noma est amis. Uno mundo. Soma c'est samis. Uno mundo. Porque est amis. Uno mundo. Just the same. Ava speaking. Uno mundo. Ava houskeeping. Uno mundo. Traditional sleeping. Uno mundo. Just the same. Uno mundo. Uno mundo. Uno mundo. Uno mundo
1125,Bula,Rock,Eu não vou me importar com você. Não preciso dos seus dilemas pra viver. Estou livre pra seguir meu caminho. A sua máscara caiu e você dançou. Você dançou no tom da música. Não queremos mais os seus problemas. Vivemos bem sem os seus dilemas. Se você ficou pra trás a escolha foi sua. Caiu de cara no chão à revelia da rua. Você dançou no tom da música. Quando alguém sequestrou a sua fé. Quando alguém roubou o melhor que você tem pra dar. Quando alguém tirou o brilho dos seus olhos. Você provou que também saber lutar. Fazer tua boca calar. Sempre me disse como eu devo ser. Só que agora cansei de você. Não queremos mais os seus problemas. Vivemos bem sem os seus dilemas. Você dançou no tom da música. Quando alguém sequestrou a sua fé. Quando alguém roubou o melhor que você tem pra dar. Quando alguém tirou o brilho dos seus olhos. Você provou que também sabe lutar
1126,Bumblefoot,Rock,Apathy and afterbirth. Wasted seeds growing in the dirt. Could it be our paths always weave. I believe in mortality. But I don't care. I don't care at all. I don't care no more. In the air apples leave the tree. In the garden snakes are scheming. Misery and the merciful. Company for the gullible. I don't care at all. I don't care no more. I'm just wastin' time. Got you on my mind.... Empathy for the cynical. Apathy and I don't care. Seeds are sewing behind every glare. Cruel roots anchor into the Earth. Afterbirth never leaves the dirt. I don't care at all. I don't care no more. I'm just wastin' time. Got you on my mind...
1127,Bumblefoot,Rock,I miss me.. Miss the noise. Miss the colored dreams. And rings.. And screams. Miss the pain of love and tragedy. It's time to decide.. How should I live each tomorrow - like the first day or the last. With silence in the sunshine or music in the darkness. Either way I'll be ok as long as when I get there I'm with you. You make me wanna live again. But what is life without knowing who I am. It's time to decide.. How should I live each tomorrow - like the first day or the last. With silence in the sunshine or music in the darkness. This peace inside is killing me - I think it might be time to leave. Feel the floodgate start to break and crash away the wall. And I awake with you. The first sight in these eyes I want is you
1128,Bumblefoot,Rock,The hair on my belly is touching my chest - the hair on my chest is touching my shoulders. It looks like I'm wearing a permanent sweater - I'm working my way toward backfur. The hair on my ass is rising up - the hair on my head is falling down. I got a spider mole that's spreading her legs - she's laying her eggs in backfur. I had a smooth body 'long time ago - then gravity gave me a few folds. Somebody shot me with a beast gun square on - the pellets were seeds of backfur. My body's 'lot wider than it used to be - too much a taste of the old country. Inherited my simian ancestry - I'm working my way toward backfur. I used to think I was invincible (10 years ago). So many things I didn't know. I never knew how cruel the world can be (silly me). My time was not complete. Poor me (poor me) I'm dying. I pushed my mind to a future height - and balanced with a pre-historic body type. Just give me my speedos and put me on a beach - I'm sporting my rolls of backfur. I keep a short comb on a stick - to pick out the occasional deer ticks. I can't afford electrolysis - face down I'm a rug of backfur. I'm pushing harder but I'm losing speed (moving so slow). So many miles left to go. I knew but couldn't feel mortality (silly me). My time was not complete. Poor me (poor me) I'm dying. I used to be a fatty fatback - an inch away from my heart-attack. I'm pushing my luck I'm chasing hot dog trucks - I'm shaded from the sun with backfur. I'm hosting a family of mosquitoes - they live beneath the thicket of Velcro. They can't find my cholesterol-high-blood-rich skin - they can't find their way out of my backfur. I didn't know my life was on the clock. Won't close my eyes anymore. A new year passes every time I blink - or so I think. My time was not complete. Poor me - I'm dying
1129,Bumblefoot,Rock,Breaking Away. Why do we go so far. Till it's too far to turn back. When we take it so far. We lose so much more. We lose it all. Stop me if I go too far. It's so hard to turn back. Don't let me take it all. Away from you. From you. So don't let go now. Please show me how. To stop this breaking away. From you
1130,Bumblefoot,Rock,"""You never had a chance. You doodied in your pants. Pant'loons - dirty pant'loons. You did the pee-pee dance. You wet your fancy pants. Pant'loons - dirty pant'loons. I was alive for only five. Shoulda played hookie and stayed at home. Where the toilet was my own. I had to go but I was too shy. Then everything came out that was inside. And in the classroom I did cry. Oh momma come and get me soon. I got a walnut in my pant'loons. CHORUS. """"Take me away"""" cried my hidden face. She held me and started down the hall. Stopped by a mop-and-bucketed man. Who with concern wanted to know all. That's when I felt something start to fall. No time for spoken words to be said. As the walnut fell from my pant-leg. He got his answer nodded his head. Can't wait for this day to end. With every moment my humility spread. I'd pay good dollar just to forget. That walnut that fell from my pant-leg. The janitor was from Winnipeg"""
1131,Bumblefoot,Rock,'Til we meet again in the morning. Starlit skies and you I'm adoring. God whispers your name to me each night. I wake up tasting your lips on mine. If I could I'd make it last for eternity. 'Til we say good night I will hold you. Close to me and thank heaven for you. Tracing lines through candlebeams. Fading light I watch you dream. If I could I'd make it last for eternity. Let each day fade away. Counting hours 'til I see your face. Counting minutes til you're with me. Each second feels like eternity. Let each day pass me by. Counting hours 'til I look in your eyes. Counting minutes it's all I can do. Waiting for each night with you. 'Til we rise to laughter & sunshine. I will thank the stars that you're all mine. You change my life with just one word. The sweetest song ever heard. If I could I'd make it last for eternity
1132,Bumblefoot,Rock,EVERYTIME I SHAKE MY HEAD (IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS). Everytime I shake my head. It's like Christmas. Was it coincidence or incidents. That had me wearing white shirts all the time. Every time I shake my head. It's Kris Kringle. And every time I brush my hair. Bells jingle. Itching leads to scratching leads to scalp chunk in my nails. My shampoo fails. My hopes and hairs run down the drain. (what a pain). It's not meant to be Christmas all the time. It's 93 degrees outside. And it's snowing. I'm Mr. Unsure lacking pride. And it's showing. Shaking heads are flaking. Dead skin on my shoulders. All the older shineheads point and giggle at my plight. (and that aint right). It's not meant to be Christmas all the time. Call it HARassed or harASSED. I've been embarrassed in the past. And now at last I've given up on reason. (not on rhyme). It's not meant to be Christmas all the time
1133,Bumblefoot,Rock,GRAY. I never thought that I would belong. And I would get along with me. I heard the things you said. Filled my empty head - drank my cup of tea. Nothing is OK. All things turn to gray. The sun is low and so am I. It took with it the seeing light. And nothing seems to be OK. When all things turn to gray. I find that pure is the mind. But spoken words can lie once they've gone astray. When I'm here I can't think or feel - nothing here is real. Can't find the words when there's nothing left to say. Nothing is OK. All things turn to gray. The sun is low and so am I. It took with it the seeing light. And nothing seems to be OK. When senses dull me into gray. My time is gone - my time is done. I missed my chance - I miss the sun. I'm standing in a room of one. I'm waiting for the light to come. And nothing seems to be OK. When all things turn to gray. Nothing is OK
1134,Bumblefoot,Rock,Maricona - can't take my eyes off of you. Maricona - I've changed from the first time I saw you. I never knew what emptiness was. Until I turned away and you were gone. Maricona - I've got a girl to save. Puerca Tonta - she's got a world to blame. Where it's dark all the time. Let me in - I'll be your sunshine. Maricona - can't take my eyes off of you. Maricona - I spend my nights dreaming of you. Waiting to see you again. Waiting to breathe again
1135,Bumblefoot,Rock,I cared too much. To keep it all together. I'm not a good pretender. I never could live a lie. I said too much. I let it get the best of me. Until it took the rest of me. I thought it was worth the fight. To fight for what's right. To right all the wrongs. To say it in our songs. To know we belong. No one understands. They don't have the desire. Got both hands in the fire. And I'd do it again. We give it all we can. All we have is desire. Got both hands in the fire. We burn & still say. Never say never say never say never again. Never say never say never say never again. I learned more from one enemy. Than from 1000 friends. That heaven takes care. Of fools & scoundrels in the end. You learn more from one lie. Than from 1000 truths. Is all worth dying for you're still not sure. But keep on chargin' through. No one understands. They don't have the desire. Got both hands in the fire. And I'd do it again. We give it all we can. All we have is desire. Got both hands in the fire. We burn & still say. Never say never say never say never again. Never say never say never say never again. Ya can't really ever say never but we. Say it again and again and again again. Never say never say never say never again. To fight for what's right. To right all the wrongs. To say it in our songs. To know we belong. We slowly lose sight. Of what made us strong. The hardest thing to do. Is to let go of your guns. No one understands. They don't have the desire. Got both hands in the fire. And I'd do it again. We give it all we can. All we have is desire. Got both hands in the fire. We burn & still say. Never say never say never say never again. Never say never say never say never again. Ya can't really ever say never but we. Say it again and again and again again. Never say never say never say never again
1136,Bumblefoot,Rock,I just got a new medication. After years of hibernation. I can walk outside for the first time. And let the sunshine touch my head. Never went an hour without. Mutilating from the inside out. Now everything's fine for the first time. I feelin' like I'm born again. I try but can't explain it - I say too much. I feel so liberated - feels like love. It's so nice to be normal - to be normal for a change. I used to stare up at the sky. And watch the little worm in my eye. But now all I wanna do is look at you. And fill your darkest room with light. I try but can't explain it - I say too much. I feel so liberated - feels like love. It's so nice to be normal - to be normal for a change.. It's so nice to be normal - but it still feels kinda strange.. The noise has left my head. The voice inside is dead. Now I don't hear a sound.. Never knew silence could ever be so loud.. It's so nice to be normal - to be normal. It's so nice to be normal - but it still feels kinda strange.
1137,Bumblefoot,Rock,Poor obsolete man - I’m a burden to you all. You're leavin' me out in the cold. My spine's collapsing - can't remember what I'm told. My entity gives way to mold. We're growing old - our functions go. We're moving slow - scraping the bone. We grow cold. Maxxing atrophy - turning back into an egg. My brittle frame covers in folds. My teeth are free from the oppression of the jaw. Got a Swiss cheese colon and an artery full of spitballs. We're growing old - our functions go. We're moving slow - scraping the bone. We grow cold
1138,Bumblefoot,Rock,Your left hand got the finger on the button. Your right forgot how to feel. Your head don't know what either one is doin'. Ya turn nothin' into such a big deal. I've been gettin' all the signals and the signs. And I've been watchin' how ya cheat and steal. And then you try to spin my name into a lie. Now won't anybody tell me what is real.. Are you listening - do you hear a thing. Even through your own shit so deafening. Up on my own feet - you can't make me drop. Try to pull me down - I'll still be on top. Now you started something that you can't stop.. There's a fine line and you think you can cross it. Rollin' along on your entitlement wheel. Who will remember you for self-importance?. At least I got to know what is real.. Well you can keep all your dirty little secrets. Of all the scapegoats you forced to kneel. I saw the world through Jesus-colored glasses. Now won't anybody tell me what is real.
1139,Bumblefoot,Rock,Rockstar For A Day. I just turned 19 for the 16th time. Posing with bottles of the finest wine. I'm only seen with people just like me. So rich that we get everything for free. Spouting politics from my limosine. Because you care - About the product in my hair. About the clothes I'm gonna wear. To the event where we congratulate ourselves. I wanna be a rockstar for a day - I want my 15 minutes of fame. But I've got face that's made for radio - And my body's a disgrace. I wanna be a rockstar for a day - I wanna get botox in LA. 'Cause I've got a face that's made for radio - And a voice that's made for... I don't know. But you'll love me anyway. So tell me tell me tell me - am i great?. Will you tattoo my CD cover on your face?. So do you wanna win a date with me?. We can talk all night about me me me? me?. Sitting by candlelight telling stories about by care. Because you care - About the product in my hair. About the clothes I'm gonna wear. To the event where we congratulate ourselves. I wanna be a rockstar for a day - I want my 15 minutes of fame. But I've got face that's made for radio - And I never could get laid. So I wanna be a rockstar for a day - I'm gonna get a pornstar for a date. But I've got a face that's made for radio - And a voice that's made for... I don't know. But you'll love me anyway. All of my entourage can join my fanclub membership. And get a year free for 1 friend & my autographed guitar pick. As for the ugly rumors they're all started by my publicist. And yes it's true - I was born on the moon and have 3000 kids. My contribution to humanity is saying I'm part of it. And when I sneeze it's history - in a century you'll read about it. Because you care - so let's congratulate ourselves.. I wanna be a rockstar for a day I want my 15 minutes of fame. But I've got face that's made for radio - And my body's a disgrace. So I wanna be a rockstar for a day - Got implants everywhere except my brain. 'Cause I've got a face that's made for radio - And a voice that's made for... I don't know. And my songs are kinda lame - Tomorrow you'll forget my name. But you'll love me for today - But you'll love me anyway. Yeah ya love me anyway
1140,Bumblefoot,Rock,Hey babe. It's been a lonely time without my lady. Too many nights - I'm coming for ya baby. I've missed you for so long. I need to be with you and never be gone. Hey sista. I left you for a dark and empty room. You opened up the door and pulled me through. You opened up my eyes. I'll love you and be by your side every day of our lives. Ronald's coming back now and he's here to stay. Back to give ya lovin' every day. Now I'm here and you're gone - it's so hard to go on. Just one day without you is too long a time.

Just one day without you is too long a time. Counting every hour in my mind. Now I know. Gone off making foolish moves. Wasting loyalty on those who prove. That my 1-face and wasted faith. Should have had more eyes to see your two-sides. And all the times you picked and choosed. Which more destructive mask you'd use. With brothers like you who needs cancer. I won't answer - I'll just leave you behind. Ronald's coming back now and he's here to stay. Back to give ya lovin' every day. Now I'm here and your gone - it's so hard to go on. Just one day without you is too long a time. Counting every hour in my mind. Now I know. To be here all alone. I'm so sorry that I left you alone. Now I know
1141,Bumblefoot,Rock,Headshrinker workin' my flava try to rearrange my psych try to voodoo my child. Bloodletter fryin' my egg chewin' my leg leechin' off my pain suckin' my brain. Big thinker masqueradin' mannequin manipulator dominator slave trader breakin' me takin' me. REFRÃO:. I don't need all your therapy. I'm alright without your insight. I was fine till you took my mind - that's when it shrunk. Chain me crack your whip on my bad trip taking me away reshapin' my clay. You're diggin' through me like a squatbug siftin through mindmud looking for a shiftkit - finding it. REFRÃO. Disablin' me you keep labelin' me you keep stickerin' me vandalizin' my skull.

1142,Bumblefoot,Rock,Thank you for being such a friend. You're by my side through thick and thin. And when these days come to an end. I know I'll be with you again. For all the times we're up and down. You know you never let me down. We've turned the page so many times. There's still so much more left to write. Thank you for all you let me be. And for euphoric memories. For the 15 minutes of fame. And all the pretty ugly things. For filling empty rooms with light. And for the sins thrown in the sea. For flowing in and out my eyes. And the taste of life between my teeth. I'll say it now while I still have the opportunity to breathe. I suffocated for so long and then you gave my heart its beat. We may be oceans far apart but deep inside you're still with me. I know we'll always be together every time I hear you sing.... A spinning world that never stops. The pushin' pushin' till we drop. The miracle of endless days. Music that never goes away. It keeps my spirit livin' on. With you in every song. So thank you and goodnight. Till I see you again on the other side...
1143,Bumblefoot,Rock,Tuesday night somebody died. While I was off living my lie. And I was blind but in my mind. All was fine to me. All must pass - nothing can last. We carry on - the line moves along. So who will cry for you?. I might - every time I breathe. Visit me in my sad dream. And tell me how I can find peace. Then tell me why the sad survive. And why we have such selfish minds. We think of our losses while your spirit flies. You took me with you - but I'll be back in time. Tuesday night someone died. But all is fine to me. Cause now I see.
1144,Bush,Rock,You in the dark. You in the pain. You on the run. Living a hell. Living your ghost. Living your end. Never seem to get in the place that I belong. Don't wanna lose the time. Lose the time to come. Whatever you say it's alright. Whatever you do it's all good. Whatever you say it's alright. Silence is not the way. We need to talk about it. If heaven is on the way. If heaven is on the way. You in the sea. On a decline. Breaking the waves. Watching the lights go down. Letting the cables sleep. Whatever you say it's alright. Whatever you do it's all good. Whatever you say it's alright. Silence is not the way. We need to talk about it. If heaven is on the way. We'll wrap the world around it. if heaven is on the way. if heaven is on the way. I'm a stranger in this town. I'm a stranger in this town. Silence is not the way. We need to talk about it. If heaven is on the way.

1145,Bush,Rock,Warm sun feed me up. And I'm leery loaded up. Loathing for a change. And I slip some boil away. Swallowed followed. Heavy about everything but my love. Swallowed sorrowed. I'm with everyone and yet not. I'm with everyone and yet not. I'm with everyone and yet. Just wanted to be myself. Hey you said that you would love to try some.

Swallowed hollowed. Sharp about everyone but yourself. Swallowed oh no. I'm with everyone and yet not. I'm with everyone and yet not. I'm with everyone and yet not. I'm with everyone and yet.

1147,Bush,Rock,You could say that all love breaks you. And every kiss is who you are. If I could tell you what I’ve been thinking. Maybe we could get along. See yourself through the mirror of the signs. It’s alright to lose your mind. In a world of paradise. Yesterday before your eyes. And all the lives you leave behind. You can’t run from what’s inside you. And what don’t kill will set you free. All those days I felt my rage. But I found the strength to be me. See yourself through the mirror of the signs. It’s alright to lose your mind. In a world of paradise. Yesterday before your eyes. And all the lives you leave behind. In a world of paradise. Don’t fake. Don’t fake anyone. Don’t lie. Don’t lie till you’re done. Dive in. Dive into everything. You could say that all love breaks you. And every kiss is who you are. See yourself through the mirror of the signs. It’s alright to lose your mind. In a world of paradise. Yesterday before your eyes. And all the lives you leave behind. In a world of paradise. Watch them fade in the shadow of the sun. Each new day the last is done
1148,Bush,Rock,You dropped the bomb using all your chlorine. You find yourself so far down its normal. There at your feet the slow burn comes. To carry back to earth or where you're from. You feed me whole varied nutrients. I lost control I trashed all my instinct. I wanted to escape to feel nothing at all. 'Cause they were alive when you spoke to me. Broken the skies and my empathy. Mine out of time she wrote to me. Will we ever come again?. England is gone the way of the gypsies. We do what we can within the system. I hope you feel the earth turn inside of you. 'Cause they were alive when you spoke to me. Broken the skies and my empathy. American eyes so close to me. Will we ever come again?. A heavy load and a fucked up system. You're on your own with all your instance. All you see is all you get. Surfing on the waves of promises. Mine out of time she wrote to me. American eyes so close to me. American eyes so close to me. American eyes. Will you ever come again?. Will you ever come again?. American eyes....

Você pensa que não vai achar. Nem mais encontrar. Você não dorme. Não quer sonhar. Sempre acordada. Pensando no que vai fazer. E no que vai falar. Suas palavras. Soltas no ar. Não dizem nada. Faz tempo que você. Não tem chão onde possa pisar

Então saia e dance agora. L.L

1244,Cachorro Grande,Rock,Lili tinha um jeito estranho. Dormia com um drinque na mão. Saía e rastejava pelo chão. Atrás de emoções baratas que a fizessem se sentir. Uma espoleta pipocando. Queria se sentir como a Greta Garbo. on the night club. Lili via assombração. Filosofava no balcão. Temia atender o telefone. E ser quem não queria. Dormia só durante o dia. Queria explodir o mundo. Queria se sentir como a Greta Garbo. on the night club

1247,Cachorro Grande,Rock,Ela vem subindo a rua. Ela vem imaginando uma solução. Ela anda no mundo da lua. Ela anda na sua solidão. Sonhos perdidos no tempo. Para onde o vento irá soprar. Ela quer entender o momento. Talvez seja a hora de repensar. Não há mais porque não acreditar. Não há mal nenhum em se deixar levar

Novas estrelas pra cuidar. Ela quer ir pro outro lugar. Aqui a chama já queimou. (...) rock n roll. Ela quer areia pra pisar. Correr de contra o mar. Ficar curtindo o por do sol.

E nada mais lhe satisfaz. Ela quer ir pro outro lugar. Ela quer ir pro outro lugar. Ela quer ir pro outro lugar. Ela quer ir pro outro lugar. Ela quer ir pro outro lugar

E me fez querer me encontrar. O mundo se abriu pra mim. Desde quando descobri. O que fez eu ir onde vou. Desde a primeira vez. O sentido que me fez. Querer ser o que hoje sou.

1263,Cachorro Grande,Rock,Vai querer me enganar?. Tu acha que eu não sei?. Esse teu blablabla. Foi eu que inventei. Pra onde você vai. E de lá já voltei. Não venha me falar. De tudo que já sei. Confesso não saquei o que aconteceu. Aquilo que restou pra mim já morreu. Só eu sei o que passei. Só eu sei o que passei. Não tente se esconder. Vejo através de você. Cato tudo no ar. Você só perde em querer jogar. Pra onde você vai. É de lá já voltei. Não venha me falar. De tudo que já sei. Confesso não saquei o que aconteceu. Aquilo que restou pra mim já morreu. Só eu sei o que passei. Tem coisas que o tempo não pode curar. Só eu sei o que passei
1264,Cachorro Grande,Rock,Aconteceu comigo algumas vezes. Mas duas delas foram bem diferentes. Naquela época eu só bebia naquele bar. Era um tipo de drive­-in. Em que as pessoas podiam comer e beber. Enquanto lavavam seus carros. Muito estranho né?. O mais estranho é que eu não saia de lá. Alguns amigos meus também. Todo mundo se chapando. Sábado principalmente. Todos ainda tínhamos empregos normais. Horários normais e ficávamos esperando. A semana inteira para chegar o fim de semana. E alguma coisa diferente acontecer. E nada acontecia. E de repente já era domingo de noite. E batia a maior tristeza. E frustração que alguém poderia ter. A ideia de começar uma semana um mês um ano. Sabendo que vai ser a mesma coisa de sempre. E que não havia saído do maldito lugar em que eu estava. Voltando com a história do bar. Eu sentava em uma mesa de frente pra rua. E ficava olhando pessoas felizes e tristes passarem. Uma vez um casal nem feliz e nem triste. Estava passando do outro lado da rua. E atravessou em minha direção. Me olhando profundamente. Como se me conhecesse. E nesse momento um carro atropelou o casal. Eu gritei com muita força e desespero ao mesmo tempo. Em que notei que o casal não existia. A não ser na minha cabeça. O carro existia mas não parou. Até hoje não sei se vi fantasmas ou foi alucinação. Isso aconteceu em passo fundo. No final da década de noventa. A outra como eu disse foi bem diferente. Foi em outro lugar e outro momento. Na época pintaram os alucinógenos e eu tava dentro. Eu queria experimentar qualquer tipo. De distorção da realidade. Minha filha tinha acabado de nascer. E eu não sabia o que fazer com a minha vida. Me sentia muito fraco pra suportar tudo aquilo. E tudo aquilo era muito pra minha cabeça de 17 anos. A casa onde eu morava e principalmente o meu quarto. Não ajudavam em nada muito escuro muito escondido. E entravam e saiam todo o tipo de pessoas possíveis. E a maioria delas eu não queria que estivesse ali. Tamanho era o meu torpor. Às vezes eu me perguntava. Como era possível morar num lugar daqueles. Sem me dar conta de que eu era o único morador. Mas nunca me senti sozinho. Mesmo quando não havia ninguém. Eu não estava sozinho. Meu maior problema era o sono quando ia dormir. Eu não conseguia descansar. Todo o tempo em que estava naquele lugar. Eu me senti muito pesado e carregado. E isso nunca aliviava. Meu sonhos também estavam muito confusos. Estava difícil separar eles da vida real. Me sentia sufocado quando dormia. E cansado e fraco quando acordava. Até hoje não sei se eram espíritos ou era só loucura. Isso aconteceu em uberlândia. No começo da dedada de noventa. Paz e amor
1265,Cachorro Grande,Rock,VOCÊ TEM QUE OLHAR A ESTRADA. COM UMA CARA CANSADA. COMO UMA VELHA AMIGA. QUE VOCÊ JÁ NÃO AGÜENTA MAIS. . ESTOU AQUI DE PASSAGEM. A VIDA É UMA MALA PRONTA PRA VIAGEM. MINHA CABEÇA É MINHA BAGAGEM. E A ESTRADA É UMA VELHA AMIGA. . COM QUEM VOCÊ PODE CONTAR VELHA AMIGA?

1326,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,It's hard to let you go. You've always let me in. And helped with all the endings. And you know where to begin. I need you here for me. Cuz you always know my heart. I can't believe we'd change. Or have to be apart. But if you've seen the love that's in her eyes. Then everything is good. And if you know the way she felt inside. She's flying where she should. I never believed we'd ever live to see. An angel being born. And flying home. It's good to know your laugh. And you'll always hold my hand. And watch from up in heaven. And always understand. We'll take you down the road. And in everything we do. We'll know how much you love us. A soul that's kind and true. And if you've seen the love that's in her eyes. Then everything is good. And if you know the way she felt inside. She's flying where she should. I never believed we'd ever live to see. An angel being born. And flying home. Ah... Can you see the love in her eyes. If you've seen the love that's in her eyes. Then everything is good. And if you know the way she felt inside. She's flying where she should. I never believed we'd ever live to see. An angel being born. And flying home again. I never believed we'd ever live to see. An angel being born. And flying home again. .
1327,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,He ran a marathon. He didn't quite finish. He didn't quite cross the finish line. Actions without love. It never really crossed his mind. He sure got the accent down. And he sure can swoon the ladies. And you know. One day he'll learn. Actions without love. Actions without love. The whole bloody language. She pulled out her chequebook. She asked what the date was. She had to double-check. Actions without love. Actions without love. She had to have an audience. Actions without love. Actions without love. Love
1328,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,When you're on your own. When you're at a fork in a road. You don't know which way to go. There's too many signs and arrows. You haven't laughed in a while. When you can't even fake a smile. When you feel ashamed. (beautiful) don't make you brave. All I can do is love you to pieces. Give you a shoulder to cry when you need it. when the day is long. and the night is coming down on you. All I can do. All I can do. All I can do. When you forget your name. The pleasure can't disguise your pain. But you don't feel the same. I won't forget the love you make. All I can do is love you to pieces. Give you a shoulder to cry on when you need it. when the day is long. and the night is coming down on you. All I can do. All I can do. All I can do. What a lovely day to shape your dreams. And you don't even have to sleep. You can make you what you want to be. You can fly away. You can change your name. Have a happy face. (It could be so real). All I can do is love you to pieces. Give you a shoulder to cry on when you need it. when the day is long. and the night is coming down on you. All I can do. All I can do. All I can do

1332,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself. Makes me want to lose myself in your arms. There's something in your voice. Makes my heart beat fast. Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life. If you knew how lonely my life has been. And how long I've been so alone. If you knew how I wanted someone to come along. And change my life the way you've done. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong. A window breaks down a long dark street. And a siren wails in the night. But I'm alright cause I have you here with me. And I can almost see through the dark there's light. If you knew how much this moment means to me. And how long I've waited for your touch. If you knew how happy you are making me. I've never thought I'd love anyone so much. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me.

1334,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,i'm jaded. and you're beautiful. i'm deluded. and envious of you. you're carin'. that i'm hurtin'. but i'm laughing. 'cause i'm lyin'. and you believe what i say. to be true. this is the way. god made me!. no self-reliance. no social skills. you're confident. and you express yourself. so well. you're learned. degrees upon your wall. i'm jealous. no invitations to the ball. this is the way. god made me. no self esteem. you're picture perfect. you walk about so contented. the trees call out your name. you're clean and i'm so ignorant. i'm basic and i'm jaded. and my excuses are so lame

1336,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,you're toast and jam. and you're cotton candy. you're double rainbows. beside a setting sun. you're wood burnin' outside. there's a fire growin'. you're sweet as green apples. you must be the one. you bring me to the heart of a golden man. you bring me to the natural truth. you take me to a solid hollow. and keep me sailing this ocean of youth. so take me to an altar of diamonds. and run with me through sheets of jungle rain. show me all your manly mystery. and let me heal your beautiful pain. be my island. in crowds of faces. my oasis. be there. lead me to the holy water. introduce me to the place you are from. wherever you go you know i will follow. so take me there and i will come. Lyrics from absolutedivas.com
1337,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,there's a man outside my door tonight. he cries for help he sings a pleading song. well times are tough for everyone. gotta hold on to what i got. and just kind of cruise along. well i do. want to be helpful. but it's cold and i'm told. you can't be too careful. out of the mouth of a mother. into the hands of a brother. into the heart of a lover. and out of the hands of another.. you can never tell who your neighbour is. or what he's doin' at night or who his friends are. well you don't know where he's from. or where he's been or who he knows. you know you can't be too careful. these days. well i do want to be helpful. whoa but it's cold. and i'm told he might just be the devil. well i don't take chances. and i don't take time to see. and i don't take nothing. from nobody. no way - not me. into the eyes of a child. into the ears of a child. into the heart of a child.
1338,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,"""""""Ba-da-da...."""". There are places I remember. All my life. Though some have changed. Some forever. Not for better. Some have gone. And some remain. All these places have their moments. With lovers and friends. I still can recall. Some are dead and some are living. In my life. I've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers. There is no one. Compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning. When I think of love. As something new. Though I know I'll never """"lose"""" affection. For people and things. That went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life. I love you more. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things. That went before.

1339,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,Let me show you what I'm made of. Good intentions are not enough. To get me through today. And this life. You're in the basement. Watching the TV. I'm on the second floor. Watching the ceiling. We sleep underneath the same big sky at night. And dream the same dream we can fly. You can run from me. And you can hide from me. But I am right beside you. In this life. Let me tell you who you really are. You're my comfort. You're not a superstar. Life can reach up and bring you back down. Onto the ground. And give you everything you dream about. You can run from me. And you can hide from me. But I am right beside you. In this life. I'll give you all the things that I'd never get. Give you all I have and have no regrets. Take you to the places that I've never been. Forgive you all the things that you can't forget. Take away the pain with my healing hand. Wash away your sins and set your spirit free. You can run from me. And you can hide from me. But I am right beside you. In this life. You can run from me. And you can hide from me. I am right beside you. In this life. Let me show you what I'm made of.
1340,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,Words & Music: Chantal Kreviazuk. I hadn?t seen the boy in fifteen years. He had lines that said he cried a rainbow of tears. He left one day before his late night drives. He said everybody?s gotta make a sacrifice. So he replaced the old girl for a boat named Jen. He thought if anyone could love her. Well he was the man. He said my only fear is growing old alone. I?ve gotta get a lover for this telephone. It doesn?t matter if my number?s gone when I?m young. But I don?t want to grow old alone. Till the day Jen sunk she gave him love so true. She was appraised at fifty-one grand or two. It didn?t matter that she took every dime that he had. He had to get off the water and live by the land. He said my only fear is growing old alone. I've gotta get a lover for this telephone. It doesn't matter if my number's gone when I'm young. But I don't want to grow old alone. When I spoke about Jen a tear flowed from his eye. It was the first and last time I saw a grown man cry. He said believe it or not I?m not scared to die. But I don?t want to grow old alone. He said my only fear is growing old alone. I've gotta get a lover for this telephone. It doesn't matter if my number's gone when I'm young. But I don't want to grow old alone.

1343,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,Words & Music: Tom Waits. Never saw the morning till I stayed up all night. Never saw the sunshine till I turned out the light. Never saw my home town till I stayed away too long. I never heard the melody till I needed the song. Never saw the white line till I was leavin' you behind. Never knew I needed you till I was caught up in a bind. And I never spoke I love you till I cursed you in vain. Never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane. Never saw the East coast until I moved to the West. I never saw the moonlight till it shone off your breast. And I never saw your heart till someone tried to steal it away. Never saw your tears till they rolled down your face. I never saw the morning till I stayed up all night. Never saw the sunshine till you turned out the light. Never saw my home town till I stayed away too long. I never heard the melody till I needed the song.
1344,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,All they know is to photograph. People when they're on their knees. Say your prayers and wear your black. And be grateful it's not you and me. How am I supposed to live. Knowing that they're dying. How am I supposed to laugh. Knowing that they're crying. When did we get so cold. When did we get so cold. When did we grow so old. So old. Raise me up to where the wind blows. Out of the ghettos oh. Raise me up to where the sun glows. Out of these shadows oh. When did we get so cold. When did we get so cold. When did we grow so old. So old

Where we can wear each other for awhile. I'll lend you my tears if I could borrow. a smile. I'll get through tomorrow somehow today. Happy After.... Once upon these days. There's four roads to anywhere. Four ways to everything. We were unbreakable. We spoke our destiny. Let's take a moment out. Go were we never go. Let's make a new world now. Where we can wear each other for awhile. I'll lend you my tears if I could borrow. your smile. We'll get through tomorrow somehow today. Happy After.... Once upon these days. Then one day we'll find. when we're looking back at this time. Wondering how we've come so far from this. When we close our eyes. What's this life anyway. What's it to you and me. What are we doing here. Who are we supposed to be. I'll take a better world. I'll take anything. I'll take our little world now. Where we can wear each other for awhile. I'll lend you my tears if I could borrow. your smile. We'll get through tomorrow somehow today. Happy After.... Once upon these days. [Thanks to Christina for lyrics]
1347,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,Time. Where did you go. WHy did you leave me here alone. Wait. Don't go so fast. I'm missing the moments as they pass. Now I've looked in the mirror. And the world's getting clearer. so wait for me. This time. I'm down. I'm down on my knees. I'm begging for all your sympathy. But you (I'm just an illusion). You don't seem to care (I wish that I could). You humble people everywhere (I don't mean to hurt you). Now I've looked in the mirror. And the world's getting clearer. I'll take what you give me. Please know that I'm learning. So wait for me. This time. I should've known better. I shouldn't have wasted those days. And afternoons and mornings. I threw them all away. Now. This is my time. And I'm gonna make this moment mine. (I shouldn't have wasted those days). I'll take what you give me. Please know that I'm learning. I've looked in the mirror. My world's getting clearer. So wait for me. This time. This time...
1348,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,Words & Music: Chantal Kreviazuk. I could almost remember your face. When I heard your voice today. I could see your lips moving. At the other end of the receiver. It was almost a very good bye. But dialtones tend to make me cry. I call back within moments. You laugh and don?t even ask why. That's what we do. Can we do it. Until we die. You don't see me but I feel so exposed. Each time there's a pause on the phone. I wish there was another button to press. So I could read your mind. In heaven we won't have to call. I'll be with you spring summer and fall. But for now soon you?ll be here. And heal in my arms as the night goes by. That's what we do. Can we do it. Until we die. So for now soon you'll be here. And heal in my arms as the night goes by. That's what we do. Can we do it. Until we die. That's what we do. Can we do it. Until we die.
1349,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,I used to carry the weight of the world. And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly. I don't know why I was so afraid. All the time. Memories seemed to bother me. My whole life. I used to carry the weight of the world. And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly. I used to carry the weight of the world. And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly. I don't know why I was so ashamed. Such a waste of time. And I don't know who I was trying to be. All those lies. I used to carry the weight of the world. And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly. I used to carry the weight of the world. And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly. Oh and there's always something. Or somebody right behind. Well we're not meant to be everything. We're just a piece. So spread your wings. Oh I don't know why I was so afraid. All the time. I used to carry the weight of the world. And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly

1351,Chantal Kreviazuk,Rock,I'm alone in this life. These old jeans are too tight. Now I can't pick my feet off the floor. I try to laugh but I cry. My dignity's undignified. Guess I'm really on my own. Nervous like a little boy. No I'm not paranoid. but I'm on to you YA YA. Well I'm not seventeen. And I don't wanna be. So why am I hiding. Is it too late to call you on the phone. Too late to tell you I'm alone. I wanna wake you from another lonely night. Too late to wonder where you are. Too late to hold you in my arms. Cause if you're looking for wonderful. I'm wonderful. I'm a very simple girl. And I don't fit into this world. The city lights leave me in a daze. And even though we've never met. You know what I'm trying to forget. Some things you can't change. Is it too late to call you on the phone. Too late to tell you I'm alone. I wanna wake you from another lonely night. Too late to wonder where you are. Too late to hold you in my arms. Cause if you're looking for wonderful. I'm wonderful. I'm underneath. I'm underneath. I'm underneath. Is it too late to call you on the phone. Too late to tell you I'm alone. I wanna wake you from another lonely night. Too late to wonder where you are. Too late to hold you in my arms. Cause if you're looking for wonderful. I'm wonderful
1352,Charge,Rock,2 o'clock and knock at my door and then. The answer is on your lips. In your hands my girlfriend. I can't sleep at night without give you a kiss. 'Cause I love when you love me. And you love when I love you. I could give you my heart. All I want tonight is you. In your hands there's nothig I can do
1353,Charge,Rock,You say that you like doing dumb things with your friends. Just to pass the time. And also say in this small town there's nothing to do. Beside get high. I know that you only fear being alone. And the thought that you might never be someone. My lovely girl what's going on?. Inside your heart your love is not a rock (alone). Good enough for you or bad enough for me?. What you're trying to do??. Make up your mind before I do it for you
1354,Chris Cornell,Rock,If you take a life. Do you know what you'll give?. Odds are you won't like what it Is. When the storm arrives. Would you be seen with me?. By the merciless eyes I've deceived. I've seen angels fall from blinding heights. But you yourself are nothing so divine. Just next in line. (Chorus). Arm yourself because no one else here will save you. The odds will betray you. And I will replace you. You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you. It longs to kill you. Are you willing to die?. The coldest blood runs through my veins. You know my name. If you come inside. Things will not be the same. When you return to the night. And if you think you've won. You never saw me change. The game that we have been playing. I've seen those diamonds cut through harder men. Then you yourself but if you must pretend. You may meet your end. (Chorus). Try to hide your hand. Forget how to feel (forget how to feel). Life is gone. At just a spin of the wheel (spin of the wheel). (Chorus). )
1355,Chris Cornell,Rock,Every time I stare into the sun. Trying to find a reason to go on. All I ever get is burned and blind. Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain. When you came along the time was right. Pulled me like an apple and ripe. Wasn't very long you took a bite. And did me wrong and it serves me right. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how it broke apart. Here we go round again.... again. Every little key unlocks the door. Every little secret has a lie. Try to take a picture of the sun. It won't help you to see the light. Every little word upon your lips. Makes a little cut where blood pours out. Every little drop of blood a kiss. That I won't miss not for anything. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how it broke apart. Here we go round again. Every single feeling tells me. This is leading to a heart. In broken little pieces. And you know I need this. Like a hole in the head. Every single feeling tells me. This is leading to a heart. In broken little pieces. And you know I need this. Like a hole in the head. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how broke apart. Here we go round again. Here we go round again. Here we go round again. Here we go round again
1356,Chris Cornell,Rock,She can do anything at all. About anything she pleases. If I were to change what she thinks is wrong. What could she want with me?. . But wait just one minute here. I can see that she's trying to read me. Suddenly I know. . She's going to change the world. But she can't change me. No she can't change me. . She has the daylight at her command.

1357,Chris Cornell,Rock,"""If I had nothing to my name. But photographs of you. Rescued from the flames. That is all I would ever need. As long as I can read. What's written on your face. The strength that shines. Behind your eyes. The hope and light. That will never die. And one promise you made. One promise that always remains. No matter the price. A promise to survive. Persevere and thrive. As we've always done. And you said. """"The poison in a kiss. Is the lie upon the lips"""". Truer words were never shared. When I feel. Like lies are all I hear. I pull my memories near. The one thing they can't take. And one promise you made. One promise that always remains. No matter the price. A promise to survive. Persevere and thrive. As you've always done. The books still open on the table. The bells still ringing in the air. The dreams still clinging to the pillow. The songs still singing in a prayer. Now my soul. Is stretching through the roots. To memories of you. Back through time and space. To carry home. The faces and the names. And photographs of you. Rescued from the flames. And one promise you made. One promise that always remains. No matter the price. A promise to survive. Persevere and thrive. And dare to rise once more. A promise to survive. Persevere and thrive. And fill the world with life. As we've always done"""
1358,Chris Cornell,Rock,Josephine where can you be now?. Again the sun is rising on my troubled heart. Don't deny you know you and I. Are the making of what fate. Just can't pull apart. My sweet Josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Sheets of rain. Cold and gray. Run down the page. Just about your name. With just the weight. Of your silent smile. Crashing all around me. While I screamed it out loud. My sweet Josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Like a raven in a cage. Blood on my birth. Just won't wash away. Like a stitched together doll. My feet to the flame. As I follow the blame. For someone else's pain. For someone else's pain. Rivers of black ink flood. A tapestry of flesh and blood around my frame. A living shrine just for you of human mind. Golden pen upon your hand. Leave this endless winter behind. My sweet josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every single kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Dying here on bended knees. Dying here on bended knees. My Josephine
1359,Chris Cornell,Rock,[Verse 1]. Time ain't nothing if it ain't fast. Taking everything that you ever had. And giving nothing in return. But a cold bed in a quiet earth. [Pre-Chorus]. But there's a door in every cell. A pearl inside of every shell. [Chorus]. How hard can it be. To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long when it feels like. We'll live forever I fear. That time will hide the years. [Verse 2]. Life ain't nothing if it ain't hard. It'll show you who you truly are. Knock you down when you get too tall. Till you spun around in a free fall. [Pre-Chorus]. But somewhere out there past the storm. Lies the shelter of your heart. [Chorus]. So how hard can it be. To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long when it feels like. We live for ever I fear. Like we were never here. So hold on tightly my dear. [Bridge]. I'm not one to waste my time. Searching for something lightning. Somewhere out there lies the stone. Lies the shelter. Of your heart. [Chorus]. So how hard can it be (how hard). To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long it feels like. We will live forever. But I fear. That time can hide the years. Like we were never here. So hold on tightly my dear. [Outro]. Before we disappear. Before we disappear
1360,Chris Cornell,Rock,On the silent night so out of place. I almost lost my nerve. When I saw you walk into my space. A woman like you I could not replace. And it took some patience to catch your eye. Patience to win your heart. Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all. It's finally forever. There's no hill I would not climb for you. No bridge I wouldn't cross. Not a moment passes in my life. That you're not on my mind. Together or apart. And it took some patience to catch your eye. Patience to win your heart. Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all. It's finally forever. Anytime you're lost. Anywhere you're found. Anytime you want. I will be around. Anywhere you seek. Anywhere you stand. Anytime you fall. Anywhere you limp. Even if you break. Anytime I can I will be there for you. I know that you'll understand. You'll understand. Now I never would have imagined this. So I thank my lucky stars. As I see you in your wedding dress. Never would have guessed you'd fill my open arms. And it took some patience to catch your eye. Patience to win your heart. Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all. Yeah it feels like I don't have to worry at all. Yeah it feels like I don't have to worry at all. It's finally forever. Finally forever
1361,Chris Cornell,Rock,This open promise fades. And the sun forgets to rise. I'm lonely and I'm thirsty. But it's better I stay dry. No more than two drinks away from crying. Stare into the glass. And wait for the time to pass. And thank you for the offer. But you know I must decline. Never more than two drinks away from crying. There used to be a time. when I could hold my head up high. My life stretched out before me. Rivers flow with wine. I had my love beside me. And everything was fine. Now the ride is over. It's hard to say goodbye. This whole promise fades. And midnight turns to day. I'd love to drown my sorrow. But I cannot tell a lie. No more than two drinks away from crying
1362,Chris Cornell,Rock,[Verse 1]. Time ain't nothing if it ain't fast. Taking everything that you ever had. And giving nothing in return. But a cold bed in a quiet earth. [Pre-Chorus]. But there's a door in every cell. A pearl inside of every shell. [Chorus]. How hard can it be. To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long when it feels like. We'll live forever I fear. That time will hide the years. [Verse 2]. Life ain't nothing if it ain't hard. It'll show you who you truly are. Knock you down when you get too tall. Till you spun around in a free fall. [Pre-Chorus]. But somewhere out there past the storm. Lies the shelter of your heart. [Chorus]. So how hard can it be.

I'm not one to waste my time. Searching for something lightning. Somewhere out there lies the stone. Lies the shelter. Of your heart. [Chorus]. So how hard can it be (how hard). To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long it feels like. We will live forever. But I fear. That time can hide the years. Like we were never here. So hold on tightly my dear. [Outro]. Before we disappear. Before we disappear
1363,Chris Cornell,Rock,Put a bend in the road. I'm too lost and tired. To see where I'm going. What I left behind. And I'm moving so slow. Don't know when I'll arrive. So put a bend in the road. I'm growing tired of straight lines. I set off for the shore. And I finally slipped away. From the ones I adored. And the place I was raised. And I rode down the road. Just to watch it go by. And when and where is love?. Maybe nowhere tonight. Everyone needs a touch. Or a shoulder for crying. They say love is a crutch. They say love is blind. And that's all that she needed. But I could not supply. When a bend in the road. Put it out of my mind. There was a strange little girl. Who was everything I ever dreamed. I could love or be loved by. So put a bridge or a hill. Or a forest of pines. Or a river of blue. I can run along side. And I'll sleep when it's night. I follow all the signs. Just put a bend in the road. I'm growing tired of straight lines. Put a bend in the road. I'm growing tired of straight lines
1364,Chris Cornell,Rock,She can do anything at all. About anything she pleases. If I were to change what she thinks is wrong. What could she want with me?. . But wait just one minute here. I can see that she's trying to read me. Suddenly I know. . She's going to change the world. But she can't change me. No she can't change me. . She has the daylight at her command. She gives the night its dreams. She can uncover your darkest fear. And make you forget you feel it. . But wait just one minute more. I can see that she's trying to free me. Suddenly I know. . She's going to change the world. But she can't change me. . Suddenly I can see everything that's wrong with me. But what can I do?. I'm the only thing I really have at all. . But wait just one minute here. I can see that she's trying to need me. Suddenly I know. . She's going to change the world. But she can't change me. No she can't change me.
1365,Chris Cornell,Rock,Night falls while drunken angels. Sleep by the side of the road. Now nodding in the stale world. Just trying to stay out of the cold. Circling around the drain. Can't find my way back home. The road is long and never ends. Dark is the heart that wanders. Light breaks in through the window. Takes a minute to know where I am. A dying blackbird gives his soul to the wind. On the roof of the house that I can see from my bed. Circling around the drain. Show me the way back home. The road is long and never ends. Dark is the heart that wanders. I crawl a hundred thousand miles. Just to see your two eyes look me over. I'd steal you flowers in the bloodshot light. Of the lonely hours of the moonless night. Just like a stray dog in the rain. I can run all night and get nowhere. I picture you out underneath the porch light. Calling my name and now you're waiting for me. I thought I heard your voice in the water. As I walked by a fountain uptown. Now I'm just an orphan left at the door of a church. Just watching the water calm down. Circling around the drain. Hope that I make it home. I've never felt so far away. Dark is the heart that wanders
1366,Chris Cornell,Rock,Staring in the mirror with two borrowed eyes. Looking for a part of me that's still alive. Waiting for my chest to fall and rise. Standing on the corner with my shirt tucked in. Summer turns to autumn. winter turns to spring. And it all flies by. Like a speeding train. Dead wishes on a broken chain. White roses in a dead man's dream. Down and out. With everything to lose. If these long dead wishes. Never do come true. Waiting for the night to come and chase away. All the flies hovering around my head. With my memories for a pillow. And all my regrets for a bed. Standing on the corner now I'm passed surprise. Yelling out a warning to some passer by. I stand just as God made me. And I lie down in disguise. Dead wishes on a burning lake. White roses for my soul to keep. Diving down with everything to win. If my long since sunken ship. Ever does come in. Down and down we all fall down. And that's how ancient mountains crumble. Time keeps moving slower. Like falling from the sun. Come and knock me over. I keep getting up. Throw a line down to me. Keep hanging on. Standing on the corner don't apologize. You don't have to bow your head or raise your eyes. Or pretend that you don't see me. Dead wishes on a broken chain. White roses in a dead man's dream. Down and out. With everything to lose. If these long dead wishes. These long dead wishes. Ever do come true. Down and down we all fall down. And that's how ancient mountains crumble
1367,Chris Cornell,Rock,come on now the curtain is drawn. and tomorrow stands before you. dressed and draped in a cold black cape. like a crow he ignores you. look again there's a beautiful girl. covers sin in a holy land shroud. it's the great disappearing act. done again for the marveled crowd. as we're chasing our tails. and biting our nails. so strong and frail. and we build and tear it down. with barely the time to say. how did it get so late. i'll never know. step outside and now the doors open wide. and the minions are eager to find him. put a million miles under your heals. and you're still behind him. cover your clocks with your chains and your locks. while the seasons get hotter and colder. stretch your faces and lie about your ages. and still you're going to get older. as we're chasing our tails. and biting our nails. so strong and frail. and we build and tear it down. with barely the time to say. how did it get so late. i'll never know. hang on till your fingers break. and your hands unwind. he will escape you every time. from under your pillows. through open windows. and out on the rails. and we build and tear it down. with barely the time to say. how did it get so late. i'll never know
1368,Chris Cornell,Rock,What have you done my little spark. Cursing my name cause again I put you out. Falling apart you tell yourself you are. Dreaming only of the ones who never dream of you. I'm your disappearing one. Vanish when the curtains drawn. But I will come again and you will let me in. And you'll see I never disappear for long. Into your room I stumble now. Too tired to cower and it's too late to draw you out. And there you lie like a painting of Christ. Bleeding on the heads of the ones who nailed you down. I'm your disappearing one. Vanish when the curtains drawn. But I will come again and you will let me in. And you'll see I never disappear for long.
1369,Chris Cornell,Rock,I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. With a graveyard tan carrying a cross. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like studying faces in a parking lot. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like driving backwards in the fog. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. The things that I've loved the things that I've lost. The things I've held sacred that I've dropped. I won't lie no more you can bet. I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget. I like gypsy moths and radio talk. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like gospel music and canned applause. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like colorful clothing in the sun. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. The things that I've loved the things that I've lost. The things I've held sacred that I've dropped. I won't lie no more you can bet. I don't want to learn what I'll need.... Bend and shape me. I love the way you are. Slow and sweetly. Like never before. Calm and sleeping. We won't stir up the past. So descretely. We won't look back. The things that I've loved the things that I've lost. The things I've held sacred that I've dropped. I won't lie no more you can bet. I don't want to learn what I'll need.... I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like playing in the sand what's mine is ours. If it doesn't remind me of anything
1370,Chris Cornell,Rock,Whatsoever I've feared has. Come to life. Whatsoever I've fought off. Became my life. Just when everyday. Seemed to greet. Me with a smile. Sunspots have faded. And now I'm doing time. Cause I fell on. Black days. Whomsoever I've cured. I've sickened now. Whomsoever I've cradled. I've put you down. I'm a search light soul. They say but I can't. See it in the night. I'm only faking. When I get it right. Cause I fell on. Black days. How would I know. That this could be my fate. So what you wanted to. See good has made you blind. And what you wanted to. Be yours has made it. Mine. So don't you lock up. Something that you. Wanted to see fly. Hands are for shaking. No not tying. I sure don't. Mind a change. But I fell on black. Days. How would I know. That this could be. My fate
1371,Chris Cornell,Rock,On the silent night so out of place. I almost lost my nerve. When I saw you walk into my space. A woman like you I could not replace. And it took some patience to catch your eye. Patience to win your heart. Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all. It's finally forever. There's no hill I would not climb for you. No bridge I wouldn't cross. Not a moment passes in my life. That you're not on my mind. Together or apart. And it took some patience to catch your eye. Patience to win your heart.

So I thank my lucky stars. As I see you in your wedding dress. Never would have guessed you'd fill my open arms. And it took some patience to catch your eye. Patience to win your heart. Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all. Yeah it feels like I don't have to worry at all. Yeah it feels like I don't have to worry at all. It's finally forever. Finally forever
1372,Chris Cornell,Rock,"""I'm drinking dust. With eyes of rust. Tonight my tears might stain your wings. So flutter home. """"Cause you're better off alone than with me. So hide your face. And tie your lace. And butterflies across your cheek. Forget how soon you become a fool for words when i. speak. Flutter Girl you don't wanna know what i live. You don't wanna take what I give. 'Cause I give nothing for free. My hands are rough. My fingers cold. And your heart so young and so naïve to ever feel for. a. moment. That I might dare to believe.... I'll tear your wings as I melt in your smile as I run. all your. colors away. Flutter Girl you don't wanna know what I live. You don't wanna take what I give. 'Cause I give nothing for free"""
1373,Chris Cornell,Rock,I know what your looking for. You've looked in these eyes before. and all you saw was blue-green water. Searching for a mirror. That would show the world not who you are. but who you want to be. And you thought you'd find that one in me. But it's been a long time. Since I heard that name. He doesn't live here anymore. Don't know where he's residing. You can wait here if you want. But I don't think he's coming back. He doesn't live here anymore. Should you find the right place. Same old place you knew before. But that won't change what hides behind the door. And what lies underneath. And the change from the inside out. He doesn't live here anymore. Don't know where he's residing. I think it's better if you go. 'Cause I don't want him coming back. Yes I know the name sounds a little bit familiar. Like a melody to a dream. Yes I know he wore the same face. the same clothes. But that was so long ago. I know who you want to find. Somewhere is the memory. of somebody I left behind. Well let's take it all in stride. It's that time to say goodbye. He doesn't live here anymore
1374,Chris Cornell,Rock,You can make somebody cry. Go on. Do what you like. I'll be there by your side. I know what the future holds. You can set the world on fire. Yeah if you want. It isn't hard. I won't be there looking on. To see the trail of lies. As you fall. But I'll take the truth. The higher truth. The higher truth. I want the truth. The higher truth. The higher truth. You can fill the world with pain. Yeah if you want. I'm felling now. You can fill the world with hate. I've seen it done before. And I know how it all works out. Make a promise if you can. You know. You'll only break it. Make a promise if you dare. Go on right ahead. And let's see where it gets you. But I'll take the truth. The higher truth. The higher truth. I want the truth. The higher truth. The higher truth. Maybe you and I one day. Will finally choose. A higher truth. Come let's sit in the sun. Feel the world spin around. As the birds fly overhead. Can't you hear the waves. Can't you feel the rain. As it falls upon your face. I'll take a truth. A higher truth. A higher truth. I want the truth. The higher truth. A higher truth. I'll take the truth. A higher truth. A higher truth. I want the truth. The higher truth. A higher truth. Maybe you and I one day will finally choose. The higher truth. Can't you feel the higher. Can't you feel the higher. As it falls around?
1375,Chris Cornell,Rock,Josephine where can you be now?. Again the sun is rising on my troubled heart. Don't deny you know you and I. Are the making of what fate. Just can't pull apart. My sweet Josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Sheets of rain. Cold and gray. Run down the page. Just about your name. With just the weight. Of your silent smile. Crashing all around me. While I screamed it out loud. My sweet Josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Like a raven in a cage. Blood on my birth. Just won't wash away. Like a stitched together doll. My feet to the flame. As I follow the blame. For someone else's pain. For someone else's pain. Rivers of black ink flood. A tapestry of flesh and blood around my frame. A living shrine just for you of human mind. Golden pen upon your hand. Leave this endless winter behind. My sweet josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every single kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Dying here on bended knees. Dying here on bended knees. My Josephine
1376,Chris Cornell,Rock,Heard it from another room. Eyes were waking up just to fall asleep. Love's like suicide. Dazed out in a garden bed. With a broken neck lays my broken gift. Just like suicide. And my last ditch. Was my last brick. Lent to finish her. Finish her. She lived like a murder. How she'd fly so sweetly. She lived like a murder. But she died. Just like suicide. Bit down on the bullet now. I had a taste so sour. I had to think of something sweet. Love's like suicide. Safe outside my gilded cage. With an ounce of pain. I wield a ton of rage. Just like suicide. With eyes of blood. And bitter blue. How I feel for you. I feel for you
1377,Chris Cornell,Rock,Every time I stare into the sun. Trying to find a reason to go on. All I ever get is burned and blind. Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain. When you came along the time was right. Pulled me like an apple and ripe. Wasn't very long you took a bite. And did me wrong and it serves me right. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how it broke apart. Here we go round again.... again. Every little key unlocks the door. Every little secret has a lie. Try to take a picture of the sun. It won't help you to see the light. Every little word upon your lips. Makes a little cut where blood pours out. Every little drop of blood a kiss. That I won't miss not for anything. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how it broke apart. Here we go round again. Every single feeling tells me. This is leading to a heart. In broken little pieces. And you know I need this. Like a hole in the head. Every single feeling tells me. This is leading to a heart. In broken little pieces. And you know I need this. Like a hole in the head. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how broke apart. Here we go round again. Here we go round again. Here we go round again. Here we go round again
1378,Chris Cornell,Rock,Waiting upon the dooms of earth and sand. In the morning a flame appears upon your hand. Swallow the fears of empty promised hearts. And remember we only just got to the stars. Save the dying arms of midnight. For the patience or lapse of light. 'Cause it's our time in the universe. Well I don't mind if we're blessed or cursed. And it's our time in the universe. Yours and mine. Breathing beneath the miles of earth and sky. And in sunlight I will appear before your eyes. So don't worry on what tomorrow holds for you. I'll be waiting at the end of every road you choose. Save the dying arms of midnight. 'Cause it's our time in the universe. Well I don't mind if we're blessed or cursed. Well it's our time in the universe. Yours and mine. See you don't fall. Don't matter the end. See it unfold no matter the needs. See it fold up whatever happens to be. It's what it will be. It's what it will be. 'Cause it's our time in the universe. Well I don't mind if we're blessed or cursed. Yeah it's our time in the universe. Yours and mine. Yours and mine
1379,Chris Cornell,Rock,The embers of the saint inside of you. Are growing as I'm bathing in your glow. I'm swallowing the poison of your flower. And hanging on the rising of my low. Colorful and falling from your mouth. Like a painted fever in recoil. Like a lie without the pain. On a pillow of your bones. I will lay across the stones. Of your shore until the tide comes crawling back. A waning hand on silver granite ways. Will mend my broken limbs and bend my haze. I'm sleeping in the silence of your voice. I'm cradling the peril of my only choice. Colorful and falling from your mouth. Like a painted fever in recoil. Like a lie without the pain. On a pillow of your bones. I will lay across the stone. Of your shore until the tide comes crawling back. Throw my pillow on the fire. Make my bed under the eye. Of your moon until the tide comes crawling back. Even though the truth can burn inside or fall behind. I will wander through your open mind. And you will find no lie can hide. Until the tide comes crawling
1380,Chris Cornell,Rock,I heard the sound bite. I read your words right. I saw the light. I heard you singing. I know this song. It's my turn to write. I put this hook inside. So you won't soon forget. I got the radar. I can see so far. With my poison eye. Yeah my poison eye. When I look hard. I see in the stars. What you've done and what lies. Awaiting for you. When I look down. I see the ground. I won't make a sound. I won't need to look at you. Inside the phone lines. You think you'll hide. And you'll be alright. You're in my sidelines. You'll have no time. Even to cry. I see your pain. I see my face on your fear. I got the radar. I can see so far. With my poison eye. Yeah my poison eye. When I look hard. I see in the stars. What you've done and what lies. Awaiting for you. When i look down. I see the ground. I won't make a sound. I won't need to look at you. I can see sparks. Over a lake at midnight. I see the smiles. Falling from your face. But you're in the dark. You're in a maze. All you can do is sit here and wait for me. And I'm coming. I know the low road. I wrote the code. To break in your heart. I see the angles. I draw the cards. That burden you so. I have the sight. That follows you morning and night. I got the radar. I can see so far. With my poison eye. Yeah my poison eye. My poison eye
1381,Chris Cornell,Rock,The A.M. finds me. Home alone awake in bed. Morning blinds me. Had that dream of you again. Fog is lifting. I realize that you're not here. And how you left me. Life disappeared. Life is rejection. I know you've had your share. But this one's special. I can't compete with her. And did she tell you. Only she could know your mind. And did she sell you. I gotta say it one time. She can be your lover. She can be your friend. She can be your vision of a mother like the one you never had. She will know your troubles better than I can. But she'll never be your man. She'll never be your man. She'll never be your man. She's got you thinking. Of a world where you might fit in. A whole lot better. Than the one you've been living in. And did she tell you. Only she could understand. And did she sell you. Only time will tell. She can be your lover. She can be your friend. She can be your vision of a mother like the one you never had. She will know your troubles better than I can. But she'll never be your man. She'll never be your man. She'll never be your man. She can be your lover. She can be your friend. She can be your vision of a mother like the one you never had. She will know your troubles better than I can. But one thing's for sure. She'll never be your man. She can be your lover. She can be your friend. A vision of a mother like the one you never had. She will know your troubles better than I can. But one thing's for sure. She'll never be your man. She'll never be your man. Never be your man. She'll never be your man. Never be your man. Never be. She'll never be your man
1382,Chris Cornell,Rock,"""If I had nothing to my name. But photographs of you. Rescued from the flames. That is all I would ever need. As long as I can read. What's written on your face. The strength that shines. Behind your eyes. The hope and light. That will never die. And one promise you made. One promise that always remains. No matter the price. A promise to survive. Persevere and thrive. As we've always done. And you said. """"The poison in a kiss. Is the lie upon the lips"""". Truer words were never shared. When I feel. Like lies are all I hear. I pull my memories near. The one thing they can't take. And one promise you made. One promise that always remains. No matter the price. A promise to survive. Persevere and thrive. As you've always done. The books still open on the table. The bells still ringing in the air. The dreams still clinging to the pillow. The songs still singing in a prayer. Now my soul. Is stretching through the roots. To memories of you. Back through time and space. To carry home. The faces and the names. And photographs of you. Rescued from the flames. And one promise you made. One promise that always remains. No matter the price. A promise to survive. Persevere and thrive. And dare to rise once more. A promise to survive. Persevere and thrive. And fill the world with life. As we've always done"""
1383,Chris Cornell,Rock,Today. Chris Cornell. Composição: Chris Cornell. I have an injury. It's there for all to see. They pay to watch as the blood pours out. And it's my priviledge. Cause I'm in danger. Yeah I'm in danger. Yeah I'm in danger. Of losing my mind. The fasination lives. Inside the world that spins. Around the scene of the accident. And they're most interested. When you're in danger. When you're in danger. When you're in danger. Of losing your mind. Of losing your mind. When I walk along the street. I see you all who know your sanity. Is hanging by a thread. I went to church today. To pray it all away. I watched the meek pass the hat around. But I'd already paid. Cause I'm in danger. Yeah I'm in danger. Yeah i'm in danger. Of losing my mind. Of losing my mind. Losing my mind. Losing my mind
1384,Chris Cornell,Rock,This open promise fades. And the sun forgets to rise. I'm lonely and I'm thirsty. But it's better I stay dry. No more than two drinks away from crying. Stare into the glass. And wait for the time to pass. And thank you for the offer. But you know I must decline. Never more than two drinks away from crying. There used to be a time. when I could hold my head up high. My life stretched out before me. Rivers flow with wine. I had my love beside me. And everything was fine. Now the ride is over. It's hard to say goodbye. This whole promise fades. And midnight turns to day. I'd love to drown my sorrow. But I cannot tell a lie. No more than two drinks away from crying
1385,Chris Cornell,Rock,Words get tangled on your tongue. And you stumble on your feet when you miss somebody. And everywhere you think you see them. Walking down the street when you miss somebody. When you miss somebody you tell yourself. a hundred thousand times. Nobody ever lives forever so you give it one more try. To wave goodbye wave goodbye. Every hurtful thing you ever said is ringing in your ear. When you miss somebody. And every thing of beauty that you see only brings a tear. When you miss somebody. When you miss somebody you tell yourself everything. will be alright. Try to stand up strong and brave when all you want to do. Is lay down and die. How long I've waited for an answer or a sign. Lonely and weary from this troubled task of trying. To wave goodbye. So now you start to recognize that every single path you see. Leads to a tear in your eye. So wave goodbye wave goodbye..
1386,Chris Cornell,Rock,If you take a life. Do you know what you'll give?. Odds are you won't like what it Is. When the storm arrives. Would you be seen with me?. By the merciless eyes I've deceived. I've seen angels fall from blinding heights. But you yourself are nothing so divine. Just next in line. (Chorus). Arm yourself because no one else here will save you. The odds will betray you. And I will replace you. You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you. It longs to kill you. Are you willing to die?. The coldest blood runs through my veins. You know my name. If you come inside. Things will not be the same. When you return to the night. And if you think you've won. You never saw me change. The game that we have been playing. I've seen those diamonds cut through harder men. Then you yourself but if you must pretend. You may meet your end. (Chorus). Try to hide your hand. Forget how to feel (forget how to feel). Life is gone. At just a spin of the wheel (spin of the wheel). (Chorus). )
1387,Chris Cornell,Rock,Sleeping on the road that takes you home. Howling at the moon at midnight. I want the wrong that sets you right. I'll be praying at your bedside. How long i've been a soul in the gutter. I don't have a home or a mother or anywhere to lay my head down. Can I visit your arms?. Can i visit your legs?. I won't need your insults or praise. Won't burn in your heart. Don't worry your head. Yeah if you don't want a soul mate. I'm your soul today. Hanging on a rope from a burning tree. Singing on a broken headstone. Bleeding from an old wound. Swimming in the fever. Waiting for a ressurection. I know it's a miracle I've lived this long. I don't want to give the wrong impression. But I've come so far. Can I visit your arms?. Can I visit your legs?. I won't need your insults or praise. Won't burn in your heart. Don't worry your head. Yeah if you don't want a soul mate. I'm your soul today. Sleeping on the road that takes you home. Howling at the moon at midnight. I want the wrong that sets you right. I'll be praying at your bedside. How long I've been a soul in the gutter. Can I visit your arms. Can I visit your legs. I won't need your insults or praise. Won't burn in your heart. Don't worry your head. Yeah if you don't want a soul mate. Can I visit your arms?. Can i visit your legs?. I won't need your insults or praise. Won't burn in your heart. Don't worry your head. Yeah if you don't want a soul mate. I'm your soul today. Your soul today

And still you care for me. Your love. You give it away. I fall to my knees and I pray. Your love. And in the crowd I smile and listen. As the children sing. Their voices caroling.

1393,Chris Isaak,Rock,Drive your mustang down. To where you hang out. Alone without a friend. Girls walk by you. Some in fact have tried you. Once they tried they never tried again. Except the new girl. Except the new girl. Alone and lonesome. Trusting no one. They say you never had a friend. People talk about you. They say they doubt you really. Ever let anybody in. Except the new girl. Except the new girl. I guess there's never been anyone else. Except the new girl. Except the new girl. Last time I saw him. He was laughing. She was standing by his side. I've got a feeling. That they're still together. >From the look that was in his eyes. There's no one. Except the new girl. Except the new girl. See him smile. He don't care. Said he loves her. And he'll always love her. See him smile. It seems fair. That he finally found her. Finally hold her. There's no one. Except the new girl. Except the new girl. Except the new girl.

1408,Chris Richardson,Rock,Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster. Than it did in the old days. So naturally we have more natural disasters. From the strain of a fast pace. Sunday was the day of rest. Now its one more day for progress. And we can't slow down. Cause more is best. It's all an endless process. Well I miss Mayberry. Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke. Where everything is black & white. Picking on a Six String. Where people pass by and you call them by their first name. Watching the clouds roll by. bye bye. Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting. Through the trees as the wind blows. Thats when I climb up here on this mountain. To look through God's window. Now I can't fly. But I've got two feet. To get me high up here. Above the noise and city streets. My worries disappear. Well I miss Mayberry. Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke. Where everything is black & white. Picking on a Six String. Where people pass by and you call them by their first name. Watching the clouds roll by. bye bye. Sometimes I dream I'm driving down an old dirt road. Not even listed on the map. I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole. But I always wake up everytime I try to turn back. Well I miss Mayberry. Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry Coke. Where everything is black & white. Picking on a Six String. Where people pass by and you call them by their first name. Watching the clouds roll by. bye bye

1410,Cinema Bizarre,Rock,We all have our secrets. They're better left unsaid. We all have our issues. That we want to forget. I was getting kicks. Out of my box of tricks.

1448,Coppala,Rock,Não sou o dono das cartas. Nem sei o que vai virar. Espero que a sorte venha me achar. Não vejo nenhuma saída. O jeito e tentar arriscar. A melhor tentativa é atitude mostrar. Não vou me prender nas desilusões do passado. Nada tenho a temer não nasci pra ficar amarrado. A minha vida eu virei tudo de cabeça pra baixo. Desse jeito eu tornei a chance do jogo mais fácil. O relógio marca tempo que eu já gastei. E por Deus não me arrependa as fichas que apostei. Eu gosto de botar pilhar. Pra ver o ponteiro girar. O tempo é curto não da pra esperar. Esse é o jogo da vida. Não se pode parar de jogar. Alguns pontos por dia eu preciso ganhar
1449,Coppala,Rock,Pode me julgar se quiser. Não perca a oportunidade. Saiba que é o tipo de mulher. Que eu morro de vontade só de pegar. Você me provocou como ninguém. Digo com sinceridade. Qual é o teu problema meu bem?. Onde esta sua coragem. De me encarar. Eu não pude suportar. Irritado eu fiquei. Já cansei de te escutar. No meu limite eu cheguei. Não adianta me ofender. Eu ja sei de toda a verdade. Nem sempre é o que parece ser. É só um truque de imagem pra te enganar. Eu já me cansei de pertecer. De toda essa bobagem. Não pense que eu vou te obedecer. Só a troco de sacanagem. Vai te catar
1450,Coppala,Rock,Te obrigam a rodar em circulos. Sem nenhuma direção. Criam tipos de vícios. Só pra você cair na tentação. Te fazem parecer um lixo. Pra que você perca a razão. Tentam com tudo isso. Arrancar o seu coração. Aproveite que seus olhos ainda podem ver (Ainda podem ver). Que o sistema só nasceu pra te explorar. Haja antes do pior acontecer (Do pior acontecer). E lute contra os que querem te matar
1451,Coppala,Rock,Vejam vocês no que o mundo se transformou. Alguém notou?. Dizem que o futuro que começou. Ninguém falou?. Olhe o preço que vamos pagar. Pelo simples fato de ignorar. Nos resta agora só acreditar. Que o retorno de Cristo vai se concretizar. Não adianta mais olhar pra trás. E se arrepender. O que plantado já foi cultivado. É chegado a hora de ir colher. Não espere que a justiça. Te de liberdade pelas coisas que fez. A maioria vai cair de joelhos. Mesmo que não tem culpa também terá que sofrer. A crueldade se multiplica. E o pecado da guerra nasce mais uma vez. É um sinal que esse é o fim dos tempos. Tudo já estava escrito nessa terra sem leis
1452,Coppala,Rock,Olho pra frente e vejo o que eu posso pegar. Há tantas coisas que estão longe pra alcançar. Eu sigo o vento que destina o meu lugar. Confio nele e deixo ele me guiar. Sinto na pele. O mar suave em brisa. Algo tão leve. Que me domina. No horizonte vem surgindo. A chama que nunca se apaga. Nesse dia tão lindo. Uma chance me foi lançada. Minha semente começou a florescer. Eu vejo a vida em minha frente aparecer. Eu tenho um guia que me levou pra ver. O céu azul é um bom lugar pra se esconder

1464,Crowded House,Pop,Somewhere deep inside. Something's got a hold on you. And it's pushing me aside. See it stretch on forever. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. Stripping back the coats. Of lies and deception. Back to nothingness. Like a weekend in the desert. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. So don't say no. Don't say nothing's wrong. Cos when you get back home. Maybe I'll be gone. It would cause me pain. If we were to end it.

1465,Crowded House,Pop,Why do I kid myself. Why do I scream for pleasure. It's four in the morning should know better. But she can weave a spell. Want it to last forever. Making me feel like somebody special. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again. Though I look everywhere. I never seem to find it. Always a shadow around a corner. Drown it in alcohol. Stuck in the elevator. Hard to remember in the morning. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again. Tell you about myself. If you're in the mood to listen. Baby you don't know who you're kissing. This is a lonely world. You are a strange companion. When you get what you wanted. You want to leave. Honestly I want to free myself. From the burden of inaction. Honestly I want to raise myself. To any plane I can imagine. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again.
1466,Crowded House,Pop,Written By N. Finn & T. Finn. Walking 'round the room singing. Stormy Weather. at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.. Well it's the same room but everything's different. You can fight the sleep but not the dream. Things ain't cooking in my kitchen. Strange affliction wash over me. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. Couldn't conquer the blue sky. Well there's a small boat made of china. Is going nowhere on the mantlepiece. Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard. Or do I sing like a bird released. CHORUS. Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you. (Repeat).
1467,Crowded House,Pop,You came. Out of this world to me. My life. Parted like the Red Sea. We flowed. Easy between the rocks and stones. Never seemed to stop us. The years. Ended in confusion. Don't ask me I don't know what happened. But I am. A man with a mission. Must be the devil I don't know. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. Hurled from my home. Into the unknown. As I walk away from you. Reveal whatever you desire. To you it may be death defying. Black day. In the coldness of winter. Black words. Slipping off my tongue. I say forget it - it's over. As a dark cloud covered up the sun. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. The sun always sets. With room for regrets. As I walk away from you. Give it to me. Give it to me. Your inspiration. Give to receive. Find all we need. As I walk away. Just a slave to ambition. Tension your permanent condition. So much you've always wanted. Too much given' you a sore head.
1468,Crowded House,Pop,Love can make you weep. Can make you run for cover. Roots that spread so deep. Bring life to frozen ground. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Turning in my sleep. Love can leave you cold. A taste of jealousy. Is like a lust for gold. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. I've been. Feeling so much older. Frame me. And hang me on the wall. I've seen. You fall into the same trap. This thing. Is happening to us all. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Somthing so strong.....
1469,Crowded House,Pop,(Neil Finn). I see a man with a flag. and he leads the procession. and a woman shedding tears. for a man locked in prison. then the two locked eyes. and for a moment I was taken. and all paths lead. to a single conclusion. Everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you. everything is good for you. one man's ending. is another man's beginning. everything is good for you. It's a nightmare talking. to a restless ocean. with a reckless calm. to state their position. but if you come undone. it might just set you free. Everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you. everything is good for you. one man's ending. is another man's beginning. bring back your head. here comes trouble. to turn me and be well. cover your heart. everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you.
1470,Crowded House,Pop,Don't stand around like friends at a funeral. Eyes to the ground. It could've been you. Why do you weep for the passing of ages. You slip with the back of your hand. You're taking it out on the one you love. I couldn't believe it. Chorus. But we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same. How long must I wait. For you to release me. I pay for each mistake. While you suffer in silence. I could still have an easy life. But the lie ain't worth the living. Once more will I hear you say. chorus 2. That we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same. Don't stand around. Like friends at a funeral. Eyes to the ground. Don't suffer in silence. 'Cause we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same. And every time I hear you. Never be the same. And every time I mess up. Never be the same.

You bend I break. I die tonight. Feeling devastated. That's what I call. Hangin' on and fallin' over. That's what I call. Tired and deflated. That's what I call. Love. I got a little room.

Baby you don't know who you're kissing. This is a lonely world. You are a strange companion. When you get what you wanted. You want to leave. Honestly I want to free myself. From the burden of inaction. Honestly I want to raise myself. To any plane I can imagine. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again.
1476,Crowded House,Pop,No night to stay in. Bad moon is rising again. Dice rolls. And you burn. Come down I fear. As that cold wheel turns. I know what I know. Sad Claude's been sleeping around. To stroke the right nerve. Whose needs do I serve. As Catherine's wheel turns. She was always the first to say gone. she's got her catherine wheels on. Always the first to say gone. Go kindly with him. To his blind apparition. His face creases up. With age gone grey. He'll back here one day. She was always the first to say gone. she's got her catherine wheels on. Always the first to say gone. She's got her catherine wheels on. Wheels on. Catherine wheels. She's gone. Vanished in the night. Broke off the logic of light. He woke. Tore the covers back. Found he was empty inside. So they were told. When the moon would rise. The best time to leave with your soul. She's gone. But towards the light. Watching her whole life unfold. Bruises come out dark. So strong was his hold on her. Regarded by some as his slave. He spoke as in a stranger's tongue. Despair us and drive you away. Bruises come out dark.
1477,Crowded House,Pop,English trees in my garden. they planted seeds in a faraway land. in between the palms and succulent grow. they loose their leaves in the winter. mark the seasons for him and for her.

1484,Crowded House,Pop,Called out to prove my love. You reply by getting defensive. Called out to prove my love. Now you should be able to sense it. I am full of your dreams. I let you sleep with the lights on. Stay with me might as well. Be the kind of girl you want to be. I am in love. I am in love. I am a fool. Fell from above. These things that I have done. They would be a test of anyone. How am I meant to see. You dressed up like your mother. They say marry your father. I hope that don’t reflect on me. They say marry your mother.

1485,Crowded House,Pop,You came. Out of this world to me. My life. Parted like the Red Sea. We flowed. Easy between the rocks and stones. Never seemed to stop us. The years. Ended in confusion. Don't ask me I don't know what happened. But I am. A man with a mission. Must be the devil I don't know. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. Hurled from my home. Into the unknown. As I walk away from you. Reveal whatever you desire. To you it may be death defying. Black day. In the coldness of winter. Black words. Slipping off my tongue. I say forget it - it's over. As a dark cloud covered up the sun. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. The sun always sets. With room for regrets. As I walk away from you. Give it to me. Give it to me. Your inspiration. Give to receive. Find all we need. As I walk away. Just a slave to ambition. Tension your permanent condition. So much you've always wanted. Too much given' you a sore head.

Be submissive just this once. Imagine there is something to be done. Some truth to tell. I would love. To trouble you in your time of need. Lose your way. It's a pleasure when you're in my command. Juggle like a diplomat. Struggle to hold onto your hat. Swinging like an acrobat. But time will tell. The clock is dripping on the wall. Listen to the rise and fall. Close your eyes and hear the call you know so well. Put on your wings. You're responsible for everything. Desolate in anger and safe in isolation. You're about to be the victim of a holy visitation. By the rites that I've been given. Put on your wings. You're not responsible for everything. I would love. To trouble you in your time of need. Lose your way. It's a pleasure when you're in my command. When you're in my command. In my command.
1487,Crowded House,Pop,I lit the match. I lit the match. I saw another monster turn to ash. Felt the burden lifted from my back. Do you recognize the nervous twitch. That exposes the weakness of the myth. When your turn comes 'round. And the light goes on. And you feel your attraction again. Your instinct can't be wrong. Separate the fiction from the fact. Been a little slow to react. But it's nearly time to flip the switch. And i'm hanging by a single stitch. Laughing at the stony face of gloom. When your turn comes 'round. And the light goes on. And you feel your attraction again. Your instinct can't be wrong. Feelings come and go. Where the true present lies are. Calling down. Laughing at the stony face of gloom. When your turn comes 'round. And the days get long. And you feel your attraction to him. Your instinct can't be wrong. Calling down

Nobody protects you... yeah. And we're losing some faith. We used to cry. We used to say why. For all I know. I might not get home. I found out. If you opened it up. We could work this out.

1499,Crowded House,Pop,Pretty soon you'll be able to remember her. Lying in the garden singing. Right where she'll always be. The door is always open. This is the place that I loved her. And these are the friends that she had. Long may the mountain ring. To the sound of her laughter. And she goes on and on. In her soft wind I will whisper. In her warm sun I will glisten.

1501,Crowded House,Pop,Love can make you weep. Can make you run for cover. Roots that spread so deep. Bring life to frozen ground. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Turning in my sleep. Love can leave you cold. A taste of jealousy. Is like a lust for gold. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. I've been. Feeling so much older. Frame me. And hang me on the wall. I've seen. You fall into the same trap. This thing. Is happening to us all. Something so strong. Could carry us away.

1505,Crowded House,Pop,Look at all the plans I made. Falling down like scraps of paper. I will leave them where they lie to remind me. From the past a rumour comes. Don't let it keep draggin' you down. Throw the memory in an open fire. You'll be free. Roll back the tombstone. Let the saints appear. Roll back the tombstone. Make a new man out of me. Beware the passenger. The train already left the station. We are neither at home nor at work. We are moving. Listen to the howling of steel. A face betraying no emotion. Like you never had a chance to be. Wild and free. Roll back the tombstone. Let the saints appear. Roll back the tombstone. Till the Lone Ranger rides again. Rides again in your mind. Rode across the open plain. All the way and back again.
1506,Crowded House,Pop,She walked her way down. It brought my mind back. From where I was trapped. How long will it take. For tension to break. Feel it sliding off. Shimmy-like cloth. I left on the ground. And I know what the answer is. And I’m happy to be here tonight. But when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. But before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. And the drummer’s counting out the start. She walked her way down. In silver and black. Tension is snapped. I picked up the trace. A scent I can’t place. Remembering desire. Higher and high. Lift off the ground. And I know what the answer is. But I’m happy to be here tonight. And when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. From before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. The drummer makes the same mistake. And my eyes are on the shape. That is captured in the light. All went quiet on the floor. When she walked her way down. As we happen to be here tonight. But don’t we make a beautiful sight. And when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. But before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. If you’re tamed by all the pressure. Everything you want to become. The drummer always comes in late. And my eyes are on the shake. That is captured in the light. And I want to feel the weightless grasp. Upon my heavy life
1507,Crowded House,Pop,Written By N. Finn & T. Finn. Walking 'round the room singing. Stormy Weather. at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.. Well it's the same room but everything's different. You can fight the sleep but not the dream. Things ain't cooking in my kitchen. Strange affliction wash over me. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. Couldn't conquer the blue sky. Well there's a small boat made of china. Is going nowhere on the mantlepiece. Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard. Or do I sing like a bird released. CHORUS. Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you. (Repeat).
1508,Crowded House,Pop,When you come across the sea. Me like a beacon guiding you to safety. The sooner the better now. And when you come the hils. Will breathe like a baby. Pulled up heaving from the bottom of the ocean. The sooner the better now. When you come to cover me with your kisses. Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lion's den. I'll know you by the thunderclap. Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions. And that is why. I stumble to my knees. And why underneath the heavens. With the stars burning and exploding. I know I could never let you down. When you come like an iceberg float in darkness. Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea. I should know you better now. When you come your majesty to entrap me. Prince of light receding. The sooner the better now. And when you come to cover me. With your kisses hard like armour. The sooner the better now. I'll know you by the thunderclap. Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions. And that is why. I stumble to my knees. And why underneath the heavens. With the stars burning and exploding. I know I could never let you down. She came out of the water. Into my horizon. Like a cumulo nimbus. Coming in from a distance. Burning and exploding. Burning and exploding. Like a slow volcano. When you come. Cover the ground with ashes. When you come.
1509,Crowded House,Pop,Walking 'round the room singing. Stormy Weather. at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.. Well it's the same room but everything's different. You can fight the sleep but not the dream. Things ain't cooking in my kitchen. Strange affliction wash over me. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. Couldn't conquer the blue sky. Well there's a small boat made of china. It's going nowhere on the mantlepiece. Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard. Or do I sing like a bird released. CHORUS. Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you. (Repeat).
1510,Crowded House,Pop,Here's someone now whose got the muscle. His steady hand could move a mountain. Expert in bed but come on now. There must be something missing. That golden one leads a double life. You'll find out. Tell me I don't know where you go. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live. And here we lie against each other. These four walls could never hold us. We're looking for wide open spaces. High above the kitchen. And we're strangers here. On our way to some other place. Tell me I don't know where you go. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live. The world where you live. When friends come round. You might remember and be sad. Behind their eyes is unfamiliar. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live....
1511,Crowded House,Pop,It could spell my mere defeat. You could find it's what you need. And tears will fall and oceans will rise. I feel the fear and I know I'm alive. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. My condition is hard to define. I'm thin and pale and I need to unwind. See no future from where I stand. For the present I am in your hands. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. And tears will fall and oceans will rise. I feel the fear and I know I'm alive. It's only passing through. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. You can touch. I won't die
1512,Crowded House,Rock,Somewhere deep inside. Something's got a hold on you. And it's pushing me aside. See it stretch on forever. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. Stripping back the coats. Of lies and deception. Back to nothingness. Like a weekend in the desert. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. So don't say no. Don't say nothing's wrong. Cos when you get back home. Maybe I'll be gone. It would cause me pain. If we were to end it. But I could start again. You can depend on it. I know I'm right. For the first time in my life. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon. That's why I tell you. You'd better be home soon
1513,Crowded House,Rock,Why do I kid myself. Why do I scream for pleasure. It's four in the morning should know better. But she can weave a spell. Want it to last forever. Making me feel like somebody special. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again. Though I look everywhere. I never seem to find it. Always a shadow around a corner. Drown it in alcohol. Stuck in the elevator. Hard to remember in the morning. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again. Tell you about myself. If you're in the mood to listen. Baby you don't know who you're kissing. This is a lonely world. You are a strange companion. When you get what you wanted. You want to leave. Honestly I want to free myself. From the burden of inaction. Honestly I want to raise myself. To any plane I can imagine. Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep). Before it gets too late (just go to sleep). Doing damage to my brain. Well here we go again.

1515,Crowded House,Rock,You came. Out of this world to me. My life. Parted like the Red Sea. We flowed. Easy between the rocks and stones. Never seemed to stop us. The years. Ended in confusion. Don't ask me I don't know what happened. But I am. A man with a mission. Must be the devil I don't know. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. Hurled from my home. Into the unknown. As I walk away from you. Reveal whatever you desire. To you it may be death defying. Black day. In the coldness of winter. Black words. Slipping off my tongue. I say forget it - it's over. As a dark cloud covered up the sun. It's hard to let go. Of all that we know. As I walk away from you. The sun always sets. With room for regrets. As I walk away from you. Give it to me. Give it to me. Your inspiration. Give to receive. Find all we need. As I walk away. Just a slave to ambition. Tension your permanent condition. So much you've always wanted. Too much given' you a sore head.
1516,Crowded House,Rock,Love can make you weep. Can make you run for cover. Roots that spread so deep. Bring life to frozen ground. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Turning in my sleep. Love can leave you cold. A taste of jealousy. Is like a lust for gold. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. I've been. Feeling so much older. Frame me. And hang me on the wall. I've seen. You fall into the same trap. This thing. Is happening to us all. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Somthing so strong.....

I see a man with a flag. and he leads the procession. and a woman shedding tears. for a man locked in prison. then the two locked eyes. and for a moment I was taken. and all paths lead. to a single conclusion. Everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you. everything is good for you. one man's ending. is another man's beginning. everything is good for you. It's a nightmare talking. to a restless ocean. with a reckless calm. to state their position. but if you come undone. it might just set you free. Everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you. everything is good for you. one man's ending. is another man's beginning. bring back your head. here comes trouble. to turn me and be well. cover your heart. everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you.
1518,Crowded House,Rock,Don't stand around like friends at a funeral. Eyes to the ground. It could've been you. Why do you weep for the passing of ages. You slip with the back of your hand. You're taking it out on the one you love. I couldn't believe it. Chorus. But we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same. How long must I wait. For you to release me. I pay for each mistake. While you suffer in silence. I could still have an easy life. But the lie ain't worth the living. Once more will I hear you say. chorus 2. That we might still survive. And rise up through the maze. If you could change your life. And never be the same. Don't stand around.

1524,Crowded House,Rock,No night to stay in. Bad moon is rising again. Dice rolls. And you burn. Come down I fear. As that cold wheel turns. I know what I know. Sad Claude's been sleeping around. To stroke the right nerve. Whose needs do I serve. As Catherine's wheel turns. She was always the first to say gone. she's got her catherine wheels on. Always the first to say gone. Go kindly with him. To his blind apparition. His face creases up. With age gone grey. He'll back here one day. She was always the first to say gone. she's got her catherine wheels on. Always the first to say gone. She's got her catherine wheels on. Wheels on. Catherine wheels. She's gone. Vanished in the night. Broke off the logic of light. He woke. Tore the covers back. Found he was empty inside. So they were told. When the moon would rise. The best time to leave with your soul. She's gone. But towards the light. Watching her whole life unfold. Bruises come out dark. So strong was his hold on her. Regarded by some as his slave. He spoke as in a stranger's tongue. Despair us and drive you away. Bruises come out dark.

1528,Crowded House,Rock,Fork lightning in your hall. Break the skin when you break the fall. I'll be the one to fix it up. Love children of the new age. Just a hippy with a weekly wage. There's no rebellion just a chance to be lazy. When fame is in your blood. You follow the science of love. Wave the magic wand. And hang on. Now the rest of us are living in a daze. Keep thinkin' 'bout the choice to be made. Here come the handmaidens of end time. Lost treasure from a primitive race. All the lives written on your face. Can't fill the canyons of yor mind. When fame is in your blood. You follow the science of love. Wave the magic wand. And hang on. Now you've changed. And jumbled the pieces you've changed. You're better before you talked. To a roomful of strangers. Here come the handmaidens of end time. When fame is in your blood. You follow the science of love. Wave the magic wand. All of your stars will fall. And all of your spells will break. So look out for number one. Fame is in your blood.
1529,Crowded House,Rock,Can you imagine that. an itch too sensitive to scratch. the light that falls through the cracks. an insect too delicate to catch.

And I can't look up. fingers of love move down. and I can't look back. fingers of love move down. Colour is its own reward. colour is its own reward. the chiming of a perfect chord. let's go jumping overboard. into waves of joy and clarity. your hands come out to rescue me. and I'm playing in the shallow water. laughing while the mad dog sleeps. And I can't look up. fingers of love move down. and I won't be hit. fingers of love move everywhere. there is time yet. fall by the way. from the cradle to the grave. from a palace to the gutter. beneath the dying waves of the sun. lie fingers of love. through waves of joy and clarity. a fallen angel walked on the sea. and I'm playing in the shallow water. laughing while the mad dog sleeps. And I can't look up. fingers of love move down. and I won't be hit. fingers of love move everywhere. there is time yet. for you to find me. and all I want. fingers of love move down

1532,Crowded House,Rock,Called out to prove my love. You reply by getting defensive. Called out to prove my love. Now you should be able to sense it. I am full of your dreams. I let you sleep with the lights on. Stay with me might as well. Be the kind of girl you want to be. I am in love. I am in love. I am a fool. Fell from above. These things that I have done. They would be a test of anyone. How am I meant to see. You dressed up like your mother. They say marry your father. I hope that don’t reflect on me. They say marry your mother. I hope that don’t put you in her company. I am in love. I am in love. I am a fool. There is no other. I am in love. I am in love. And what I say is no lie. But it’s enough to make you wonder.

1534,Crowded House,Rock,You're standing in a deep dark hole. Beneath a sky as black as coal. It's just the fear of losing control. You know so well. Don't miss it when the moment comes. Be submissive just this once. Imagine there is something to be done. Some truth to tell. I would love. To trouble you in your time of need. Lose your way. It's a pleasure when you're in my command. Juggle like a diplomat. Struggle to hold onto your hat. Swinging like an acrobat. But time will tell. The clock is dripping on the wall. Listen to the rise and fall. Close your eyes and hear the call you know so well. Put on your wings. You're responsible for everything. Desolate in anger and safe in isolation. You're about to be the victim of a holy visitation. By the rites that I've been given. Put on your wings. You're not responsible for everything. I would love. To trouble you in your time of need. Lose your way. It's a pleasure when you're in my command. When you're in my command. In my command.
1535,Crowded House,Rock,I lit the match. I lit the match. I saw another monster turn to ash. Felt the burden lifted from my back. Do you recognize the nervous twitch. That exposes the weakness of the myth. When your turn comes 'round. And the light goes on. And you feel your attraction again. Your instinct can't be wrong. Separate the fiction from the fact. Been a little slow to react. But it's nearly time to flip the switch. And i'm hanging by a single stitch. Laughing at the stony face of gloom. When your turn comes 'round. And the light goes on. And you feel your attraction again. Your instinct can't be wrong. Feelings come and go. Where the true present lies are. Calling down. Laughing at the stony face of gloom. When your turn comes 'round. And the days get long. And you feel your attraction to him. Your instinct can't be wrong. Calling down

1541,Crowded House,Rock,Down on the ocean floor. That's where I'm heading for. Hold on to a sinking stone. Until the worst is known. Nobody wants to think about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody protects you. They make it go away. Pretending that it's all ok. Broken pieces on the ground. And everyone's tiptoeing round. Nobody wants to think about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody protects you... yeah. And we're losing some faith. We used to cry. We used to say why. For all I know. I might not get home. I found out. If you opened it up. We could work this out. Nobody wants to think about it. Nobody wants to talk about it now. What you suspected all along. Everything he told you was wrong. And you can see it if you want. Nobody wants to. (Neil's mummerings to the end)

1546,Crowded House,Rock,Say that again. I wont forget. The phrase that turned in my head. And at the start. It makes no sense. A long time left to understand. There on the shore. The girl that i adore. She combs her hair on the sand. I know youv got to fight the plan. you got to bend the rules. yeah i know. you got be your own man. you got break the rules. i think too much. the alphabet. they dance a pirhoutte in my head. a chance remark. becomes the spark. and maybe luck has come again. the hint of a smile. the accidental rhyme. that captured me the first time. and i know. youv got to fight the plan. you've got to bend the rules. yeah i know. you got to be your on man. you got to break the rules.

1547,Crowded House,Rock,Pretty soon you'll be able to remember her. Lying in the garden singing. Right where she'll always be. The door is always open. This is the place that I loved her. And these are the friends that she had. Long may the mountain ring. To the sound of her laughter. And she goes on and on. In her soft wind I will whisper. In her warm sun I will glisten. 'Till we see her once again. In a world without end. We owe it all to Frank Sinatra. The song was playing a she walked into the room. After the long weekend. They were a lifetime together. Appearing in the eyes of children. In the clear blue mountain view. The colouring in the sky. And painting ladders to heaven. And she goes on. In her soft wind I will whisper. In her warm sun I will glisten. 'Till we see her once again. In a world without end. In her soft wind I will whisper. In her warm sun I will glisten. And I always will remember. In a world without end. She goes on. She goes on. She goes on.
1548,Crowded House,Rock,Now you're heading down to get someone. Should've done what he had to do years ago. The position is coming through. All the people that you're standing on. All the people that you're standing on. Now you're heading down to be someone. Someone that you've seen in a magazine. Your premonition is coming true. Oh baby you're not so green. No baby you're not so green. No baby you're nutso. Sister madly waking up the dead. You're systematically stepping on my head. Now you're heading down to find something. Something that you buried in your backyard. The position is coming through. From all the dirt that you're digging up. From all the dirt that you're digging up. Now you're heading down to be somewhere. Somewhere you imagined in your wildest dream. The opposition is coming through. From all the people that you're standing on. From all the people that you're standing on. Now you'd better take a firm hand. Sister madly waking up the dead. You're systematically stepping on my head. Now you're heading down to get someone. Someone that you should've had years ago. The position is coming through. All the people that you're standing on. All the people that you're standing on. You're hard to get a hand on. Sister madly waking up the dead. Systematically stepping on my head.
1549,Crowded House,Rock,Love can make you weep. Can make you run for cover. Roots that spread so deep. Bring life to frozen ground. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Turning in my sleep. Love can leave you cold. A taste of jealousy. Is like a lust for gold. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. I've been. Feeling so much older. Frame me. And hang me on the wall. I've seen. You fall into the same trap. This thing. Is happening to us all. Something so strong. Could carry us away. Something so strong. Could carry us today. Somthing so strong.....
1550,Crowded House,Rock,Watch out big ships are waiting. Salt frozen on your cheek. I saw a girl and boy arriving. And a steamer put out to sea. Tall tree. Stand in the distance. Remember. When you were green. Don't wipe. The salt from your skin. You must keep running the distance. Sun sleeps on misty morning. Light years from channel three. I feel halfway to zero. Call me a hero I might just agree. Tall tree. Stand in the distance. Remember. When you were green. Don't wipe. The salt from your skin. You must keep running the distance. And the roses you grow. Have a powerful scent. They'll be breaking your heart. By the morning. I feel halway to zero. Call me a hero I might just agree. Tall tree. Stand in the distance. Remember. When you were green. Don't wipe. The salt from your skin. Tall tree. Tall tree. Don't wipe. The salt from your skin. You must keep running the distance. Tall tree.
1551,Crowded House,Rock,You take away my air. You make my lungs collapse. I die tonight. Feeling devastated. That's what I call. Livin' in your memory. That's what I call. Tired and deflated. That's what I call. Love. I tidy up your room. You tidy up my life. Show me the door. I'm abandoned here. I'm warm to the core. I can feel. You sink I swim. We never got in that deep. You bend I break. I die tonight. Feeling devastated. That's what I call. Hangin' on and fallin' over. That's what I call. Tired and deflated. That's what I call. Love. I got a little room. The air's still pretty bad. I die tonight. Feeling devastated. That's what I call. Hangin' on and fallin' over. That's what I call. Tired and deflated. That's what I call. Feeling devastated. That's. Livin' with a vacuum cleaner. What. Sweepin' up your memory. I call Love.
1552,Crowded House,Rock,Together alone. above and beneath. we were as close. as anyone can be. now you are gone. far away from me. as is once will always be. together alone. anei ra maua (here we are together). e piri tahi nei (in a very close embrace). e noha tahi nei (being together). ko maua anake (just us alone). kei runga a Rangi (Rangi the sky-father is above). ko papa Kai raro (the earth mother is below). e mau tonu nei (our love for one another). kia mau tonu ra (is everlasting). Together alone. shallow and deep. holding our breath. paying death no heed. I'm still your friend. when you are in need. as is once will always be. earth and sky. moon and sea.
1553,Crowded House,Rock,Look at all the plans I made. Falling down like scraps of paper. I will leave them where they lie to remind me. From the past a rumour comes. Don't let it keep draggin' you down. Throw the memory in an open fire. You'll be free. Roll back the tombstone. Let the saints appear. Roll back the tombstone. Make a new man out of me. Beware the passenger. The train already left the station. We are neither at home nor at work. We are moving. Listen to the howling of steel. A face betraying no emotion. Like you never had a chance to be. Wild and free. Roll back the tombstone. Let the saints appear. Roll back the tombstone. Till the Lone Ranger rides again. Rides again in your mind. Rode across the open plain. All the way and back again.
1554,Crowded House,Rock,She walked her way down. It brought my mind back. From where I was trapped. How long will it take. For tension to break. Feel it sliding off. Shimmy-like cloth. I left on the ground. And I know what the answer is. And I’m happy to be here tonight. But when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. But before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. And the drummer’s counting out the start. She walked her way down. In silver and black. Tension is snapped. I picked up the trace. A scent I can’t place. Remembering desire. Higher and high. Lift off the ground. And I know what the answer is. But I’m happy to be here tonight. And when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. From before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. The drummer makes the same mistake. And my eyes are on the shape. That is captured in the light. All went quiet on the floor. When she walked her way down. As we happen to be here tonight. But don’t we make a beautiful sight. And when you’re in the moment. Everything you want is right. But before she takes a step. She’s waiting for the beat to arrive. If you’re tamed by all the pressure. Everything you want to become. The drummer always comes in late. And my eyes are on the shake. That is captured in the light. And I want to feel the weightless grasp. Upon my heavy life
1555,Crowded House,Rock,Written By N. Finn & T. Finn. Walking 'round the room singing. Stormy Weather. at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.. Well it's the same room but everything's different. You can fight the sleep but not the dream. Things ain't cooking in my kitchen. Strange affliction wash over me. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire. Couldn't conquer the blue sky. Well there's a small boat made of china. Is going nowhere on the mantlepiece. Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard. Or do I sing like a bird released. CHORUS. Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you. (Repeat).
1556,Crowded House,Rock,When you come across the sea. Me like a beacon guiding you to safety. The sooner the better now. And when you come the hils. Will breathe like a baby. Pulled up heaving from the bottom of the ocean. The sooner the better now. When you come to cover me with your kisses. Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lion's den. I'll know you by the thunderclap. Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions. And that is why. I stumble to my knees. And why underneath the heavens. With the stars burning and exploding. I know I could never let you down. When you come like an iceberg float in darkness. Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea. I should know you better now. When you come your majesty to entrap me. Prince of light receding. The sooner the better now. And when you come to cover me. With your kisses hard like armour. The sooner the better now. I'll know you by the thunderclap. Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions. And that is why. I stumble to my knees. And why underneath the heavens. With the stars burning and exploding. I know I could never let you down. She came out of the water. Into my horizon. Like a cumulo nimbus. Coming in from a distance. Burning and exploding. Burning and exploding. Like a slow volcano. When you come. Cover the ground with ashes. When you come.

1558,Crowded House,Rock,Here's someone now whose got the muscle. His steady hand could move a mountain. Expert in bed but come on now. There must be something missing. That golden one leads a double life. You'll find out. Tell me I don't know where you go. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live. And here we lie against each other. These four walls could never hold us. We're looking for wide open spaces. High above the kitchen. And we're strangers here. On our way to some other place. Tell me I don't know where you go. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live. The world where you live. When friends come round. You might remember and be sad. Behind their eyes is unfamiliar. Do you climb into space. To the world where you live. The world where you live....
1559,Crowded House,Rock,It could spell my mere defeat. You could find it's what you need. And tears will fall and oceans will rise. I feel the fear and I know I'm alive. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. My condition is hard to define. I'm thin and pale and I need to unwind. See no future from where I stand. For the present I am in your hands. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. And tears will fall and oceans will rise. I feel the fear and I know I'm alive. It's only passing through. And you can touch me. I won't hide. You can touch me. I won't die. You can touch. I won't die
1560,Dan Auerbach,Rock,The games we play. The tales we spin. Ain't always the way. Original sin. Would you die for me in the icy sea?. Pry me free from this life I lead. Undertow. Settled in this from so long ago. Here they come to drag me down below. Here they come the undertow. Soldier of fortune. Who broke down doors. Sign of the scorpion or out of law. Would you die for me in the icy sea?. Pry me free from this life I lead. Undertow. Settled in there from so long ago. Here they come to drag me down below. Here they come the undertow. Undertow. Settle in there from so long ago. Here they come to drag me down below. Here they come the undertow
1561,Dan Auerbach,Rock,I moved from New York. With my boogie board. And bought a big house on the ocean. I stopped being me. I took the shoes off my feet. Just because I took the notion. My hair gave in so my beard came out. Caused quite a face of commotion. It grew past my lips and then it covered my mouth. So no one could read my emotions. Malibu Man. Isn't life great. Got the world in his hands. Malibu Man. Sometimes I get up. But I'm feeling down. I don't have a sister or brother. No family no wife. But I'm still living my life. Just step from a stone to another. I'm a myth of man. I ride the waves when I can. I make the music so people will buy it. I take pride in my ways. And my colossal duvets. I'm just an old fashion retailers riot. Malibu Man. Isn't life great. Got the world in his hands. Malibu Man
1562,Dan Auerbach,Rock,Everyday is just a little white lie. Telling myself I'm gettin' by. I just stay in this room and cry. The snow it covers up the ground. And I can't hear a single sound. I'd turn off the TV and go for a drive. But I can't see there's any signs of life. Kept a Christmas tree with blinking lights. I coulda made it but I messed around. I'm a loser with a rusty crown. Scared if I jump in the ocean I might drown. King of a One Horse Town. I'm the King of a One Horse Town. And I barely pull my weight around. I thought about leaving but I don't know. Wouldn't even know anywhere to go. Guess I'll stay on desolation row. Go get stoned and hang around. The beat of my drum is the only sound. I would jump into the ocean but I'm scared I'd drown. King of a One Horse Town. I'm a King of a One Horse Town. I'm a King of a One Horse Town. And I barely pull my weight around. I'm a King of a One Horse Town. King of a One Horse Town. I'm a King of a One Horse Town. And I barely pull my weight around
1563,Dan Auerbach,Rock,Never in my wildest dreams. Would I be loving you. Never in my wildest dreams. Would my dreams come true. You're just too good to touch. I can't discuss it much. I get too choked up. Don't wanna make a scene. Never in my wildest dreams. Never in my wildest dreams. Would I roam this land. Sail across the seven seas. I'm a hard luck man. But I know what my purpose is. It ain't no some pilgrimage. Its wherever my baby is. My love supreme. Never in my wildest dreams. Walk in the cold cold wind. Carry my laundry bin. Take my recs for a spin. Watch daytime tv. You're just too good to touch. And I can't discuss it much. I get too choked up. Don't wanna make a scene. Never in my wildest dreams
1564,Dan Auerbach,Rock,I've been thinking. I've been humming. I've been picking. And I've been strumming. Just waiting. Waiting on a song. I've been hitching. I've been thumbing. I can almost hear one coming. I'm just waiting. Waiting on a song. I look down in my pocket. Underneath the bed. I walked under a lamp post. And one hit me on the head. Am I blind or too dumb to see?. All the sounds surrounding me. I'm just waiting. Waiting on a song. You can look up at the stars. Bow your head and count the cars. You'll still be waiting. Waiting on a song. Might be a blue bird or a crow. On a cord between two posts. They're just waiting. Waiting on a song. Songs don't blow on trees. You gotta pick them out the breeze. You fall down on your knees. And pray one comes along. When those railroad gates come down. You gotta stop and turn around. Or you'll be waiting. Waiting on a song. You'll be waiting. Waiting on a song
1565,Dan Auerbach,Rock,There's a man in a blue plaid shirt comin' knocking. I don't know what he's coming for. But I know it's probably isn't gonna hurt anybody.

1578,Danko Jones,Rock,I bought a white cadillac. I bought it off my Mom and Dad. They said don't forget the keys son. So you can get it on. I keep the backseat for loving. I like to drive upfront. And when we're making out. I keep your boy in the trunk. I like it when you're licking ice cream. It gets all over the upholstry. Don't like it hard I like it soft. So I can lick it off. And when its midnight. And I'm about to drive by. You got to kiss me on my cheek. Before we say goodbye.

1582,Danko Jones,Rock,All you want to be is insane. Wishing you were more than just plain. And when you try you try too hard it comes off fake. Many times I wanted to say. Plastic people like you will break. And soon enough it caught up and you went away. And if I. Never see. You Again. It'll be too soon to make amends. And if I. Never see. You Again. It'll be too soon to make amends. You like it when you make people wait. It's the only time you're calling the plays. Controlling nothing makes you execrate. Everybody knows you're in pain. We all know it stems from the shame. Because your actions called for a drastic fall from grace. And if I. Never see. You Again. It'll be to soon to make amends. And if I. Never see. You Again. It'll be to soon to make amends. You suck up life like you're a needle. Sticking in a vein for life. Keep up appearances when needed. You're used to changing overnight. I always wondered if you saw. What the rest of us could see. Your every day's a final straw. Can't see the forest for the trees. And if I. Never see. You Again. It'll be to soon to make amends. (4x)

1595,Danko Jones,Rock,I'm terrified - of your eyes. They can be so cold. I lie at night - waiting tight. For the bell to toll. Therein lies - what I know. That'll make us fold. I realize - that our time. Is just growing old. And every day it may feel. Like we're getting close. But the rug under us. Always getting pulled. I'm terrified - of the lies. That you holding close. I can feel - that the seal's already broke. And when it's finally time. And you need to go. I'll be there unprepared. Holding on to hope. And every day it may feel. Like we're getting close. But the rug under us. Always getting pulled. It's a sign that our time with each. Others's over. I'm terrified - I'm terrified of you. I know that everything has to expire. You know this too. Like needles wanting to pierce. Through my eyes. Always cruel. I'm terrified - of your eyes. They can be so cold. I'm terrifed - of the lies. That you holding close. I'm numb to you. And every day it may feel. Like we're getting close. I'm terrified. I'm terrified of you

1599,Danni Carlos,Pop,Eu quero ficar perto. De tudo o que acho certo. Até o dia em que eu mudar de opinião. A minha experiência. Meu pacto com a ciência. Meu conhecimento é minha distração. Coisas que eu sei. Eu adivinho sem ninguém ter me contado. Coisas que eu sei. O meu rádio relógio mostra o tempo errado. Aperte o play. Eu gosto do meu quarto. Do meu desarrumado. Ninguém sabe mexer na minha confusão. É o meu ponto de vista. Não aceito turistas. Meu mundo ta fechado pra visitação. Coisas que eu sei. O medo mora perto das idéias loucas. Coisas que eu sei. Se eu for eu vou assim não vou trocar de roupa. É minha Lei. Eu corto os meus dobrados. Acerto os meus pecados. Ninguém pergunta mais depois que eu já paguei. Eu vejo o filme em pausas. Eu imagino casas. Depois eu já nem lembro do que eu desenhei. Coisas que eu sei. Não guardo mais agendas no meu celular. Coisas que eu sei. Eu compro aparelhos que eu não sei usar. Eu já comprei. Ás vezes dá preguiça. Na areia movediça. Quanto mais eu mexo mais afundo em mim. Eu moro num cenário. Do lado imaginário. Eu entro e saio sempre quando eu tô afim. Coisas que eu sei. As noites ficam claras no raiar do dia. Coisas que eu sei. São coisas que antes eu somente não sabia... (2vezes). Agora eu sei...!
1600,Danni Carlos,Pop,Não leve a mal. se eu fico um pouco zonza. Luzes de neon. acendem quando você passa. Não leve a mal. ver você me faz querer viajar. pra perto da lua. no azul do seu olhar. Não leve a mal. Não leve a mal. se eu pareço um pouco louca. ando tão distraída. sonhando com beijos na boca. Não leve a mal. Se quando você me olha. eu finjo que não quero. só pra fazer mistério. Acontece assim. com o meu coração. bate só por uma pessoa sem muita razão. de repente chuva. de repente trovão. o que eu sinto por você virou uma tempestade. e vai na sua direção. Não leve a mal. se eu mudo feito a moda. hoje eu fico insegura. mais amanhã quero aventura. não leve a mal. se eu ficar muito apaixonada. podia ser incrível. podia ser nós dois. podia ser verdade. Não leve a mal.
1601,Danni Carlos,Pop,Enquanto ela dormia ele a tentava em seus pensamentos. Enquanto a noite vinha ela temia poder cair a qualquer momento. Porque a verdade aparece voce vai ver. A verdade não esquece até dissolver uma lágrima quente quem te fez chorar. Meu arcanjo anda armado pra me defender. E com seu corpo fechado põe pra correr. Toda sombra que sisme pousar do meu lado. . Agora ela entende que ser valente é ter paciência a cada minuto. Não basta somente querer tanto se as atitudes já diziam tudo. Preste atenção. Você vai ficar velho um dia. Aceito sua mão mas não caio em sua armadilha. . . Porque a verdade aparece você vai ver. A verdade não esquece até dissolver uma lágrima quente quem te fez chorar. Meu arcanjo anda armado pra me defender. E com seu corpo fechado põe pra correr. Toda sombra que sisme pousar do meu lado
1602,Danni Carlos,Pop,Faça suas curvas. Dê as suas voltas. Mas não fuja de mim. Mande suas esmolas e letras. Mensagens que congelam meu jardim. Seu medo é a faca que me mata. E essa lua cheia judia de mim. E o vento que procura nossos beijos. No baixo enquanto as pessoas. Fazem contas que não batem. Essa sensação estúpida. Essa sensação estúpida. De sentir e não dizer.... Eu amo você (4x)
1603,Danni Carlos,Pop,Every time I look. Into your lovely eyes. I see a love that money. Just can't buy. One look. From you. I drift away. I pray. That you. Are here. To stay. Anything you want. You got it. Anything you need. You got it. Anything at all. You got it. Baby. Every time I hold you. I begin to understand. Everything about you. Tells me. I'm your man. I live. My life. To be. With you no one. Can do. The things you do. Anything you want. You got it. Anything you need. You got it. Anything at all. You got it. Baby. Anything you want. You got it. Anything you need. You got it. Anything at all. You got it. Baby. I'm glad to give. My love to you. I know. You feel. The way I do. Anything you want. You got it. Anything you need. You got it. Anything at all. You got it. Baby. Anything you want. You got it. Anything you need. You got it. Anything at all. You got it. Baby. . BY EVJR
1604,Danni Carlos,Pop,She's got a smile that it seems to me. Reminds me of childhood memories. Where everything. Was as fresh as the bright blue sky. Now and then when I see her face. She takes me away to that special place. And if I stared too long. I'd probably break down and cry. Sweet child o' mine. Sweet love of mine. She's got eyes of the bluest skies. As if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes. And see an ounce of pain. Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place. Where as a child I'd hide. And pray for the thunder. And the rain. To quietly pass me by. ohh... Sweet child o' mine. oh oh oh.. Sweet love of mine. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Sweet child o' mine
1605,Danni Carlos,Pop,I step off the train. I'm walking down your street again. And past your door. But you don't live there anymore. It's years since you've been there. Now you've disappeared somewhere. Like outer space. You've found some better place. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. Could you be dead?. You always were two steps ahead. Of everyone. We'd walk behind while you would run. I look up at your house. And I can almost hear you shout. Down to me. Where I always used to be. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. Back on the train. I ask why did I come again. Can I confess. I've been hanging around your old address?. And the years have proved. To offer nothing since you moved. You're long gone. But I can't move on. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. I step off the train. I'm walking down your street again. And past your door. I guess you don't live there anymore. It's years since you've been there. Now you've disappeared somewhere. Like outer space. You've found some better place. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. (deserts miss the rain)
1606,Danni Carlos,Pop,Hoje eu acordei sentido. Hoje eu acordei pensando. Nesses dias todos sem você. O vento mudando e minha cabeça. Hora lembra que eu esqueça. Mas meu corpo chama. Chora e nunca se engana. Chuva quer cair. Pra me dizer. Que pra amar. Não bastar estar perto. É preciso estar dentro. E nada vai nos separar. Nem o tempo
1607,Danni Carlos,Pop,A gente faz drama enquanto o mundo se acaba. A gente se casa e logo se fere. A gente procura e no fim não acha. A gente se gasta e ainda sobra pele. A gente vai embora e o silência rasga. A gente disputa enquanto tudo permanece igual. O amor envelhece então não sobra nada. Além do espaço do que poderia ser. Então não venha me privar da solidão. Quando não for pra me fazer companhia. Se não for me levar pra cobertura. Nem me convide pra entrar no elevador. Que esse mundo tá besta e eu não gosto de sol. Me chame pra dançar. Me invente um apelido. Se eu não gosto de isca pra quê ter um anzol?. Me chame pra dançar. Me invente um apelido
1608,Danni Carlos,Pop,Enquanto ela dormia ele a tentava em seus pensamentos. Enquanto a noite vinha ela temia poder cair a qualquer momento. Porque a verdade aparece voce vai ver. A verdade não esquece até dissolver uma lágrima quente quem te fez chorar. Meu arcanjo anda armado pra me defender. E com seu corpo fechado põe pra correr. Toda sombra que sisme pousar do meu lado. . Agora ela entende que ser valente é ter paciência a cada minuto. Não basta somente querer tanto se as atitudes já diziam tudo. Preste atenção. Você vai ficar velho um dia. Aceito sua mão mas não caio em sua armadilha. . . Porque a verdade aparece você vai ver. A verdade não esquece até dissolver uma lágrima quente quem te fez chorar. Meu arcanjo anda armado pra me defender. E com seu corpo fechado põe pra correr. Toda sombra que sisme pousar do meu lado
1609,Danni Carlos,Pop,Sorry. Is all that you can say. Years gone by and still. Words don't come easily. Like sorry like sorry. Forgive me. Is all that you can say. Years gone by and still. Words don't come easily. Like forgive me forgive me. But you can say baby. Baby can I hold you tonight. Maybe if I told you the right words. At the right time you'd be mine. I love you. Is all that you can say. Years gone by and still. Words don't come easily. Like I love you I love you. But you can say baby. Baby can I hold you tonight. Maybe if I told you the right words. at the right time you'd be mine. Baby can I hold you tonight. Maybe if I told you the right words. at the right time you'd be mine. You'd be mine. You'd be mine....
1610,Danni Carlos,Pop,Eu quero ficar perto. De tudo o que acho certo. Até o dia em que eu mudar de opinião. A minha experiência. Meu pacto com a ciência. Meu conhecimento é minha distração. Coisas que eu sei. Eu adivinho sem ninguém ter me contado. Coisas que eu sei. O meu rádio relógio mostra o tempo errado. Aperte o play. Eu gosto do meu quarto. Do meu desarrumado. Ninguém sabe mexer na minha confusão. É o meu ponto de vista. Não aceito turistas. Meu mundo ta fechado pra visitação. Coisas que eu sei. O medo mora perto das idéias loucas. Coisas que eu sei. Se eu for eu vou assim não vou trocar de roupa. É minha Lei. Eu corto os meus dobrados. Acerto os meus pecados. Ninguém pergunta mais depois que eu já paguei. Eu vejo o filme em pausas. Eu imagino casas. Depois eu já nem lembro do que eu desenhei. Coisas que eu sei. Não guardo mais agendas no meu celular. Coisas que eu sei. Eu compro aparelhos que eu não sei usar. Eu já comprei. Ás vezes dá preguiça. Na areia movediça. Quanto mais eu mexo mais afundo em mim. Eu moro num cenário. Do lado imaginário. Eu entro e saio sempre quando eu tô afim. Coisas que eu sei. As noites ficam claras no raiar do dia. Coisas que eu sei. São coisas que antes eu somente não sabia... (2vezes). Agora eu sei...!
1611,Danni Carlos,Pop,Faça suas curvas. Dê as suas voltas. Mas não fuja de mim. Mande suas esmolas e letras. Mensagens que congelam meu jardim. Seu medo é a faca que me mata. E essa lua cheia judia de mim. E o vento que procura nossos beijos. No baixo enquanto as pessoas. Fazem contas que não batem. Essa sensação estúpida. Essa sensação estúpida. De sentir e não dizer.... Eu amo você (4x)
1612,Danni Carlos,Pop,I'm sorry. Why should I say I'm sorry?. If I hurt you. You know you've hurt me too. But you get lost inside your tears. And there is nothing I can do. Cause I get lost inside my fear. That I am nothing without you. You're angry. Why shouldn't you be angry?. With what we've been through. Well I get angry too. But you get lost inside your tears. And there is nothing I can do. Cause I get lost inside my fear. That I am nothing without you. Cause I am nothing without you. Why should we have taken so long. To be looking inside of our mind?. Everything we tried went wrong. Are we worried 'bout what we might find?. I'm sorry. But can I say I'm sorry?. If I hurt you. You know it hurts me too. But you get lost inside your tears. And there is nothing I can do. 'Cause I get lost inside my fear. That I am nothing without you. That I am nothing without you. And you get lost inside your tears. And there is nothing I can do. 'Cause I get lost inside my fear. That I am nothing without you. That I am nothing... without you. . By thiago venuto
1613,Danni Carlos,Pop,Olhando alto o que você vê. sera que você me ve la. chegando em casa o que você quer. macio de uma mulher. escuta o tempo que ele está passando. agora.... se estao te dando tudo mastigado. por que você demora. pra correr com lobos. saltando as fogueiras. pra correr com lobos. Saltando as fogueiras. às vezes dizer não. pode fazer bem pros dois. por que quando é verdade. tudo vira sim depois. é um caminho solitário. mas a noite vai chegar. melhor não segurar em mim. eu só quero te levar. pra correr com lobos. saltando as fogueiras. pra correr com lobos. saltando as fogueiras. pra correr com lobos. saltando as fogueiras
1614,Danni Carlos,Pop,I step off the train. I'm walking down your street again. And past your door. But you don't live there anymore. It's years since you've been there.

1615,Danni Carlos,Pop,Hoje eu acordei sentindo. Hoje eu acordei pensando. Nesses dias todos sem você. O vento mudando e minha cabeça. Hora lembra que eu esqueça. Mas meu corpo chama. Chora e nunca se engana. Chuva quer cair. Pra me dizer. (refrão). Que pra amar. Não bastar estar perto. É preciso estar dentro. E nada vai nos separar. Nem o tempo.
1616,Danni Carlos,Pop,Não leve a mal. se eu fico um pouco zonza. Luzes de neon. acendem quando você passa. Não leve a mal. ver você me faz querer viajar. pra perto da lua. no azul do seu olhar. Não leve a mal. Não leve a mal. se eu pareço um pouco louca. ando tão distraída. sonhando com beijos na boca. Não leve a mal. Se quando você me olha. eu finjo que não quero. só pra fazer mistério. Acontece assim. com o meu coração. bate só por uma pessoa sem muita razão. de repente chuva. de repente trovão. o que eu sinto por você virou uma tempestade. e vai na sua direção. Não leve a mal. se eu mudo feito a moda. hoje eu fico insegura. mais amanhã quero aventura. não leve a mal. se eu ficar muito apaixonada. podia ser incrível. podia ser nós dois. podia ser verdade. Não leve a mal.
1617,Danni Carlos,Pop,Foi na velha cidade. Que eu te encontrei pela primeira vez. Parecia estar de passagem. pra depois sumir. Tão solitário quanto um rei. que tudo tem mas não está. Seguindo sua própria lei. Tem tanta pressa de chegar. Aonde nunca ninguém mais chegou. Amando mais que se podia alguém. seus olhos de serpente encontraram os meus. do nada.... seus olhos de serpente encantaram os meus. do nada.... Tudo o que eu queria. era mesmo ficar perto de você. Todo mundo via a sintonia de nós dois. Os meus amigos eram os teus. e na amizade o amor está dormindo. quando amanhecer tem tanta pressa de chegar
1618,Danni Carlos,Pop,Eu fiz no paraíso. É tudo que eu preciso. Pra mim é tudo ou nada. Não sou persona grata. Na selva desse mundo. Se a gente não vai fundo. Não tem pra ninguém. Eu vivo do meu jeito. Ninguém nasceu perfeito. A vida é muito louca. Não vou calar a boca. O tempo não espera. A gente virar fera. Pra ser o que tem. Pra se dar bem. Tem hora. Se demorar. Perdeu. No vale tudo da beleza. Vale cama e mesa e paixão. No jogo da vida a gente engana o coração. Posso até vender ilusão. Ouça o que eu digo. Eu sou um perigo. E se for preciso. Pego pesado. Eu sou dinamite. Qualquer coisa vira explosão. Eu sou sem limite. Entro sem convite. E se der errado. Pego pesado. Ouça o que eu digo. Quero o mundo na minha mão
1619,Danni Carlos,Pop,She's got a smile that it seems to me. Reminds me of childhood memories. Where everything. Was as fresh as the bright blue sky. Now and then when I see her face. She takes me away to that special place. And if I stared too long. I'd probably break down and cry. Sweet child o' mine. Sweet love of mine. She's got eyes of the bluest skies. As if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes. And see an ounce of pain. Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place. Where as a child I'd hide. And pray for the thunder. And the rain. To quietly pass me by. ohh... Sweet child o' mine. oh oh oh.. Sweet love of mine. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Sweet child o' mine
1620,Danni Carlos,Pop,Sweet dreams are made of this. Who am I to disagree?. I travel the world. And the seven seas--. Everybody's looking for something.. Some of them want to use you. Some of them want to get used by you. Some of them want to abuse you. Some of them want to be abused.
1621,Danni Carlos,Pop,and so it is. just like you said it would be. life goes easy on me. most of the time. and so it is. the shorter story. no love no glory. no hero in her skies. i can't take my eyes off of you. and so it is. just like you said it should be. we'll both forget the breeze. most of the time. and so it is. the colder water. the blower's daughter. the pupil in denial. i can't take my eyes off of you. did I say that I loathe you?. did I say that I want to. leave it all behind?. i can't take my mind off of you. my mind. 'til I find somebody new
1622,Danni Carlos,Pop,I'm not a perfect person. There're many things I wish I didn't do. But I continue learning. I never meant to do those things to you. And so I have to say before I go. That I just want you to know. I've found a reason for me. To change who I used to be. A reason to start over new. And the reason is you. I'm sorry that I hurt you. It's something I must live with everyday. And all the pain I put you through. I wish that I could take it all away. And be the one who catches all your tears. That's why I need you to hear. I've found a reason for me. To change who I used to be. A reason to start over new. And the reason is you (x4). I'm not a perfect person. I never meant to do those things to you. And so I have to say before I go. That I just want you to know. I've found a reason for me. To change who I used to be. A reason to start over new. And the reason is you. I've found a reason to show. a side of me you didn't know. a reason for all that I do. and the reason is you
1623,Danni Carlos,Pop,Fechei meus olhos com suas mãos. Esquenta a minha língua. E me dê seu medo. Quero o seu desejo. Quero o seu desejo. Quero o seu desejo. Morra. Antes que você morra. Antes que você corra. De você. Nade até chegar. Ou pedir socorro. Até gozar de novo. E amanhece o dia. Quero o seu desejo. Quero o seu desejo. Quero o seu desejo. Eu gosto de arrepio na nuca. Me encoste e vou tirando suas luvas. Sinto a onda aqui e vem chegando. E então suje as suas mãos comigo. Me despedace e coma o meu umbigo
1624,Danni Carlos,Pop,Quer me dizer. Que as palavras. Não se aguentam mais. Em minha boca. Que minha marra. E a minha farra. E a fama de louca. São os motivos pra você agir assim. Vem me falar. Que os meus olhos. Sempre estão em outro lugar. Que minha condição. É só querer namorar. Quando a liberdade só vale pra um. Eu sou sensível. Não grita que eu choro. Eu sou terrível. Quando as regras não vem. Mas eu me jogo quando muitos pensam. E nunca penso quando você tem. Amor pra me dar. Calor pra me dar. A mão pra me dar. Duvido eu soltar. Duvido eu soltar. Me dediquei. O quanto eu podia. Até bife fritei. Ao som da melodia. Que eu fiz pra você. Enquanto você via. O seu filme passar. Se me distraí. Desculpa alguma coisa. Foi o meu dda. Mas o meu coração compensa. Não vai falta carinho pra você. Eu sou sensível. Não grita que eu choro. Eu sou terrível. Quando as regras não vem. Mas eu me jogo quando muitos pensam. E nunca penso quando você tem. Amor pra me dar. Calor pra me dar. A mão pra me dar. Duvido eu soltar. Duvido eu soltar. Amor pra me dar. Calor pra me dar. A mão pra me dar. Duvido eu soltar. Duvido eu soltar
1625,Danni Carlos,Pop,Today is gonna be the day. That they're gonna throw it back to you. By now you should've somehow. Realised what you gotta do. I don't believe that anybody. Feels the way I do about you now. Backbeat the word was on the street. That the fire in your heart is out. I'm sure you've heard it all before. But you never really had a doubt. I don't believe that anybody feels. The way I do about you now. And all the roads we have to walk are winding. And all the lights that lead us there are blinding. There are many things that I would. Like to say to you. but I don't know how. Because maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me ?. And after all. You're my wonderwall. Today was gonna be the day?. But they'll never throw it back to you. By now you should've somehow. Realised what you're not to do. I don't believe that anybody. Feels the way I do. About you now. And all the roads that lead you there were winding. And all the lights that light the way are blinding. There are many things that I would like to say to you. I don't know how. I said maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me ?. And after all. You're my wonderwall. I said maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me ?. And after all. You're my wonderwall. Said maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me. You're gonna be the one that saves me. You're gonna be the one that saves me
1626,Danni Carlos,Pop,Every time I look. Into your lovely eyes. I see a love that money. Just can't buy. One look. From you. I drift away. I pray. That you. Are here. To stay. Anything you want.

Everything we tried went wrong. Are we worried 'bout what we might find?. I'm sorry. But can I say I'm sorry?. If I hurt you. You know it hurts me too. But you get lost inside your tears. And there is nothing I can do. 'Cause I get lost inside my fear. That I am nothing without you. That I am nothing without you. And you get lost inside your tears. And there is nothing I can do. 'Cause I get lost inside my fear. That I am nothing without you. That I am nothing... without you. . By thiago venuto
1641,Danni Carlos,Rock,Olhando alto o que você vê. sera que você me ve la. chegando em casa o que você quer. macio de uma mulher. escuta o tempo que ele está passando. agora.... se estao te dando tudo mastigado. por que você demora. pra correr com lobos. saltando as fogueiras. pra correr com lobos. Saltando as fogueiras. às vezes dizer não. pode fazer bem pros dois. por que quando é verdade. tudo vira sim depois. é um caminho solitário. mas a noite vai chegar. melhor não segurar em mim. eu só quero te levar. pra correr com lobos. saltando as fogueiras. pra correr com lobos. saltando as fogueiras. pra correr com lobos. saltando as fogueiras
1642,Danni Carlos,Rock,I step off the train. I'm walking down your street again. And past your door. But you don't live there anymore. It's years since you've been there. Now you've disappeared somewhere. Like outer space. You've found some better place. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. Could you be dead?. You always were two steps ahead. Of everyone. We'd walk behind while you would run. I look up at your house. And I can almost hear you shout. Down to me. Where I always used to be. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. Back on the train. I ask why did I come again. Can I confess. I've been hanging around your old address?. And the years have proved. To offer nothing since you moved. You're long gone. But I can't move on. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. I step off the train. I'm walking down your street again. And past your door. I guess you don't live there anymore. It's years since you've been there. Now you've disappeared somewhere. Like outer space. You've found some better place. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. (deserts miss the rain)
1643,Danni Carlos,Rock,Hoje eu acordei sentindo. Hoje eu acordei pensando. Nesses dias todos sem você. O vento mudando e minha cabeça. Hora lembra que eu esqueça. Mas meu corpo chama. Chora e nunca se engana. Chuva quer cair. Pra me dizer. (refrão). Que pra amar. Não bastar estar perto. É preciso estar dentro. E nada vai nos separar. Nem o tempo.
1644,Danni Carlos,Rock,Não leve a mal. se eu fico um pouco zonza. Luzes de neon. acendem quando você passa. Não leve a mal. ver você me faz querer viajar. pra perto da lua. no azul do seu olhar. Não leve a mal. Não leve a mal. se eu pareço um pouco louca. ando tão distraída. sonhando com beijos na boca. Não leve a mal. Se quando você me olha. eu finjo que não quero. só pra fazer mistério. Acontece assim. com o meu coração. bate só por uma pessoa sem muita razão. de repente chuva. de repente trovão. o que eu sinto por você virou uma tempestade. e vai na sua direção. Não leve a mal. se eu mudo feito a moda. hoje eu fico insegura. mais amanhã quero aventura. não leve a mal. se eu ficar muito apaixonada. podia ser incrível. podia ser nós dois. podia ser verdade. Não leve a mal.
1645,Danni Carlos,Rock,Foi na velha cidade. Que eu te encontrei pela primeira vez. Parecia estar de passagem. pra depois sumir. Tão solitário quanto um rei. que tudo tem mas não está. Seguindo sua própria lei. Tem tanta pressa de chegar. Aonde nunca ninguém mais chegou. Amando mais que se podia alguém. seus olhos de serpente encontraram os meus. do nada.... seus olhos de serpente encantaram os meus. do nada.... Tudo o que eu queria. era mesmo ficar perto de você. Todo mundo via a sintonia de nós dois. Os meus amigos eram os teus. e na amizade o amor está dormindo. quando amanhecer tem tanta pressa de chegar
1646,Danni Carlos,Rock,Eu fiz no paraíso. É tudo que eu preciso. Pra mim é tudo ou nada. Não sou persona grata. Na selva desse mundo. Se a gente não vai fundo. Não tem pra ninguém. Eu vivo do meu jeito. Ninguém nasceu perfeito. A vida é muito louca. Não vou calar a boca. O tempo não espera. A gente virar fera. Pra ser o que tem. Pra se dar bem. Tem hora. Se demorar. Perdeu. No vale tudo da beleza. Vale cama e mesa e paixão. No jogo da vida a gente engana o coração. Posso até vender ilusão. Ouça o que eu digo. Eu sou um perigo. E se for preciso. Pego pesado. Eu sou dinamite. Qualquer coisa vira explosão. Eu sou sem limite. Entro sem convite. E se der errado. Pego pesado. Ouça o que eu digo. Quero o mundo na minha mão
1647,Danni Carlos,Rock,She's got a smile that it seems to me. Reminds me of childhood memories. Where everything. Was as fresh as the bright blue sky. Now and then when I see her face. She takes me away to that special place. And if I stared too long. I'd probably break down and cry. Sweet child o' mine. Sweet love of mine. She's got eyes of the bluest skies. As if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes. And see an ounce of pain. Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place. Where as a child I'd hide. And pray for the thunder. And the rain. To quietly pass me by. ohh... Sweet child o' mine. oh oh oh.. Sweet love of mine. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Sweet child o' mine
1648,Danni Carlos,Rock,Sweet dreams are made of this. Who am I to disagree?. I travel the world. And the seven seas--. Everybody's looking for something.. Some of them want to use you. Some of them want to get used by you. Some of them want to abuse you. Some of them want to be abused.
1649,Danni Carlos,Rock,and so it is. just like you said it would be. life goes easy on me. most of the time. and so it is. the shorter story. no love no glory. no hero in her skies. i can't take my eyes off of you. and so it is. just like you said it should be. we'll both forget the breeze. most of the time. and so it is. the colder water. the blower's daughter. the pupil in denial. i can't take my eyes off of you. did I say that I loathe you?. did I say that I want to. leave it all behind?. i can't take my mind off of you. my mind. 'til I find somebody new
1650,Danni Carlos,Rock,I'm not a perfect person. There're many things I wish I didn't do. But I continue learning. I never meant to do those things to you. And so I have to say before I go. That I just want you to know. I've found a reason for me. To change who I used to be. A reason to start over new. And the reason is you. I'm sorry that I hurt you. It's something I must live with everyday. And all the pain I put you through. I wish that I could take it all away. And be the one who catches all your tears. That's why I need you to hear. I've found a reason for me. To change who I used to be. A reason to start over new. And the reason is you (x4). I'm not a perfect person. I never meant to do those things to you. And so I have to say before I go. That I just want you to know. I've found a reason for me. To change who I used to be. A reason to start over new. And the reason is you. I've found a reason to show. a side of me you didn't know. a reason for all that I do. and the reason is you
1651,Danni Carlos,Rock,Fechei meus olhos com suas mãos. Esquenta a minha língua. E me dê seu medo. Quero o seu desejo. Quero o seu desejo. Quero o seu desejo. Morra. Antes que você morra. Antes que você corra. De você. Nade até chegar. Ou pedir socorro. Até gozar de novo. E amanhece o dia. Quero o seu desejo. Quero o seu desejo. Quero o seu desejo. Eu gosto de arrepio na nuca. Me encoste e vou tirando suas luvas. Sinto a onda aqui e vem chegando. E então suje as suas mãos comigo. Me despedace e coma o meu umbigo
1652,Danni Carlos,Rock,Quer me dizer. Que as palavras. Não se aguentam mais. Em minha boca. Que minha marra. E a minha farra. E a fama de louca. São os motivos pra você agir assim. Vem me falar. Que os meus olhos. Sempre estão em outro lugar. Que minha condição. É só querer namorar. Quando a liberdade só vale pra um. Eu sou sensível. Não grita que eu choro. Eu sou terrível. Quando as regras não vem. Mas eu me jogo quando muitos pensam. E nunca penso quando você tem. Amor pra me dar. Calor pra me dar. A mão pra me dar. Duvido eu soltar. Duvido eu soltar. Me dediquei. O quanto eu podia. Até bife fritei. Ao som da melodia. Que eu fiz pra você. Enquanto você via. O seu filme passar. Se me distraí. Desculpa alguma coisa. Foi o meu dda. Mas o meu coração compensa. Não vai falta carinho pra você. Eu sou sensível. Não grita que eu choro. Eu sou terrível. Quando as regras não vem. Mas eu me jogo quando muitos pensam. E nunca penso quando você tem. Amor pra me dar. Calor pra me dar. A mão pra me dar. Duvido eu soltar. Duvido eu soltar. Amor pra me dar. Calor pra me dar. A mão pra me dar. Duvido eu soltar. Duvido eu soltar
1653,Danni Carlos,Rock,Today is gonna be the day. That they're gonna throw it back to you. By now you should've somehow. Realised what you gotta do. I don't believe that anybody. Feels the way I do about you now. Backbeat the word was on the street. That the fire in your heart is out. I'm sure you've heard it all before. But you never really had a doubt. I don't believe that anybody feels. The way I do about you now. And all the roads we have to walk are winding. And all the lights that lead us there are blinding. There are many things that I would. Like to say to you. but I don't know how. Because maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me ?. And after all. You're my wonderwall. Today was gonna be the day?.

1656,Daughtry,Rock,I'm underwater. And I'm on fire. There's nothing wilder than my heart. Just let the current. Set it in emotion. Then nothing can keep us apart. We're all swimming into the light. I want you by my side. And I'm right here waiting for you. Right here waiting for you. We're all living on borrowed time. I've been holding my breath all night. Waiting for you.

1658,Daughtry,Rock,There's a place where you can. Light the fire and watch it burn. Lay it down and lose it all. It's taken me so far beyond the point of no return. Gave all that I had when hope was gone. Is this real or is it just another crazy dream. That someday soon will fade away. Feels just like I'm under water and can barely breathe. Dying in the bed that I have made. I don't wanna drown in you. I'm Sinking and I'm torn in two. So when you see me come up for air. Don't try to hold me down. Just save me now. Don't let me drown in you. This city pulls me in closer than I've ever been. There ain't no way I can escape. Without a doubt you know that I would tread the deepest end. A thousand years forever and a day. I don't wanna drown in you. I'm Sinking and I'm torn in two. So when you see me come up for air. Don't try to hold me down. Just save me now. Don't let me drown in you. Did I bring this on myself. Can I get out alive. I've given you the best of me. Now you won't the rest of me. What's it gonna take to survive
1659,Daughtry,Rock,Cry out all who care to know. I've been hollow way too long. I know where I'm going wrong. There's nothing I can do. I believe you can get me through. (It's you that I believe). Nothing else will do. I believe you can get me through. So can you stop the bleeding?. Get me through.... Color blind I paint your blue sky grey. But this time you'll shed some light on me. Just before I fade away. There's nothing I can do. I believe you can get me through. (It's you that I believe). Nothing else will do. I believe you can get me through. So can you stop the bleeding?. Get me through.... All the chances that you're takin'. The promises that I keep breaking down. Writings on the wall. Can't make out all the letters. But I know it's getting better now. The writings on the wall. Get me through.... There's nothing I can do. I believe you can get me through. (It's you that I believe). Nothing else will do. I believe you can get me through. So can you stop the bleeding?. Get me through...
1660,Daughtry,Rock,Dusty roads. Hopeless eyes. Looking at. The blinding lights. I saw your ghost. Here tonight. It lingers on. And I feel you alive. Pulling me back to the place. But the thought of staring back at you. Is more than I can face. And its a long way now. Where I used to rest my head. And Its safe and sound. If only I could turn around. Theres no direction where I stand. Just dead end signs and wasted land. And its a long way now to you. Trusted hope. She left me standing by. To find what's lost. Is it in her eyes. Pulling me back to the place. Just thinking of myself without you. Is more than I can take. And its a long way now. Where I used to rest my head. And Its safe and sound. If only I could turn around. Theres no direction where I stand. Just dead end signs and wasted land. And its a long way now to you. to you?. to you?. to you?. I saw your ghost. Here tonight. It lingers on. And I feel you alive. And its a long way now. Where I used to rest my head. And Its safe and sound. If only I could turn around. Theres no direction where I stand. Just dead end signs and wasted land. And its a long way now. Where I used to rest my head. And Its safe and sound. If only I could turn around. Theres no direction where I stand. Just dead end signs and wasted land.

1661,Daughtry,Rock,Your life is like a crack in the mirror. 7 years of bad luck it aint getting better now. Not till all is said and done. Reflection in the window is the same old face. Background small town everywhere you look around. Tell me what you're runnin from. Flip a coin and let it land in your hand. Heads you gonna stay but its tails. [Chorus]. So you can move to another town. Hide where you're sure you wont be found. But its still just you on the inside. You can pretend it'll be alright. Said it to yourself but you know its just a lie. Cause its still just you on the inside. Still you on the inside.... [Verse 2]. Nothin faster than the speed of your leavin. A hundred miles an hour and there aint no slowin down. But you can't outrun yourself. Hey you can say you fit in like a joker in the deck. But now you're skipping like a broken record goin round. You're the last to ask for help. You flip a coin and let it land in your hand. Heads you gonna stay but its tails. [Chorus]. So you can move to another town. Hide where you're sure you wont be found. But its still just you on the inside. You can't pretend it'll be alright. Said it to yourself but you know its just a lie. Cause its still just you on the inside. Still you on the inside. [Bridge]. Its never really been a question of how far. And at the end of every destination there you are. [Ending chorus]. You can move to another town. Hide where you're sure you won't be found. But its still just you on the inside. You can pretend it will be alright. No matter how you sell it. When you tell it its a lie. Cause its still just you on the inside. Still you on the inside (you can go and change and to me you'll always be the same). Still you on the inside (you can try and run and know you'll always be the same inside). Still you on the inside (you can go and change and to me you'll always be the same). Still you on the inside (you can try and run and know you'll always be the same inside). Still love you on the inside.
1662,Daughtry,Rock,A single rose left to remember. As a single tear falls from her eye. Another cold day in december. A year from the day she said goodbye. It seems it's only been a moment. Since the angels took him from her arms. She was left there. Holding on to their tomorrow. But as they lay him in the ground. Her heart would sing without a sound. For the first time you can open your eyes. And see the world without your sorrow. Where no one knows the pain you left behind. And all the peace you could never find. It's waiting there to hold and keep you. Welcome to the first day of your life. Just open up your eyes. Eyes. A single lifetime lays behind her. As she draws her final breath. Just beyond the door he'll find her. Taking her hand he softly says. For the first time you can open your eyes. And see the world without your sorrow. Where no one knows the pain you left behind. All the the peace you could never find. It's waiting there to hold and keep you. Welcome to the first day of your life. Just open up your eyes. As I lay you down tonight. Safe on the other side. No more tears to cry. For the first time you can open your eyes. And see the world without your sorrow. Where no one knows the pain you left behind. Or the peace you could never find. It's waiting there to hold and keep you. Welcome to the first day of your life. Just open up your eyes. Eyes. Eyes. Eyes
1663,Daughtry,Rock,I thought it would be easy. But it ain't for me. It's kinda hard when you lay your heart. On a one-way street. I really thought by now. You would've slipped my mind. But the kind of love sent from above. Is the killing kind. Put my mind to rest and try to sleep it off. It'll be alright when the morning comes. Or am I wrong?. Ain't no doubt about it. I can't live without it. Tried to forget you. But I can't get you outta my head. Just when I think you're gone. You come back and turn it on. And just like a simple song. I can't get you outta my head. Well I saw you dancin'. Dancin' in my dreams. I saw your face and I can't erase. All the things I've seen. Even if I try. Cause Lord knows I've tried. I can't escape. And I can't shake the pain inside. Crazy when she comes and crazy as she goes. I'm holding out my hands with nothing left to show. Guess that's the way it goes. Ain't no doubt about it. I can't live without it. Tried to forget you. But I can't get you outta my head. Just when I think you're gone. You come back and turn it on. And just like a simple song. I can't get you outta my head. Can't get you outta my head. Can't get you outta my head. Crazy when she comes and crazy as she goes. I'm holding out my hands with nothing left to show. Guess that's the way it goes. Can't get you outta my head. Ain't no doubt about it. I can't live without it. Tried to forget you. But I can't get you outta my head. Just when I think you're gone. You come back and turn it on. And just like a simple song. I can't get you outta my head. Can't get you outta my head. Can't get you outta my head
1664,Daughtry,Rock,Hood of my car. Radio's just loud enough so I can hear levon. Where you are is anybody's guess but mine. Just a song that we grew up on. Constellations seem so outta line. But I'm wishing we could make it this time. If somebody's out there. Show me that you care. Give me a sign that comes outta nowhere. Like a shooting star. Or maybe life on mars. Something inside tells me. We can't be too far 'cause. I can see me on a spaceship leaving here only to find. That we're not the only ones. We're not the only ones. Call me a fool for. Daydreaming in the dark and. Throwing bottles at the moon. Why you're gone is nobody's fault but mine. Another song that we grew up on. Can anybody tell me where I can find. That girl I can't get out of my mind. If somebody's out there. Show me that you care. Give me a sign that comes outta nowhere. Like a shooting star. Or maybe life on mars. Something inside tells me. We can't be too far 'cause. I can see me on a spaceship leaving here only to find. That we're not the only ones. Looking for love and. Looking for something more. When it's not enough. We gotta stay above the clouds. 'cause with our feet both on the ground. We'll never learn. I can see me on a spaceship leaving here only to find. That we're not the only ones. Somebody's out there. Show me that you care. Give me a sign that comes outta nowhere. Like a shooting star. Maybe life on mars. Something inside tells me. We can't be too far 'cause. I can see me on a spaceship leaving. Come see for yourself if you don't believe me. Together we will find that we're not the only ones. We're not the only ones

1666,Daughtry,Rock,Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired?. Hollowed out and feeling uninspired. The question I keep asking is what. Will it take to ease your worried mind. Your worried mind. Now you're letting your confusion take control. And leading you down a dark and lonely road. Even that won't last forever. Just look around and see you're not alone. You're not alone.

1667,David Bowie,Rock,Ziggy played guitar. jamming good with Weird and Gilly. And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand. But made it too far. Became the special man. then we were Ziggy's band. Ziggy really sang. screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo. Like some cat from Japan. he could lick 'em by smiling. He could leave 'em to hang. Came on so loaded man. well hung and snow white tan. So where were the spiders while. the fly tried to break our balls. Just the beer light to guide us. So we bitched about his fans and. should we crush his sweet hands?. Ziggy played for time. Jiving us that we were voodoo. The kids were just crass. he was the nazz. With God given ass. He took it all too far but. boy could he play guitar. Making love with his ego. Ziggy sucked up into his mind. Like a leper messiah. When the kids had killed the man. I had to break up the band. Ziggy played gui... tar
1668,David Bowie,Rock,I've nothing much to offer. There's nothing much to take. I'm an absolute beginner. And I'm absolutely sane. As long as we're together. The rest can go to hell. I absolutely love you. But we're absolute beginners. With eyes completely open. But nervous all the same. If our love song. Could fly over mountains. Could laugh at the ocean. Just like the films. There's no reason. To feel all the hard times. To lay down the hard lines. It's absolutely true. Nothing much could happen. Nothing we can't shake. Oh we're absolute beginners. With nothing much at stake. As long as you're still smiling. There's nothing more I need. I absolutely love you. But we're absolute beginners. But if my love is your love. We're certain to succeed. If our love song. Could fly over mountains. Sail over heartaches. Just like the films. There's no reason. To feel all the hard times. To lay down the hard lines. It's absolutely true.
1669,David Bowie,Rock,It's just a one dollar secret. A lover's secrets in the UK. Torn apart in the UK. In the dribble of May-Day. '87 and Cry. '87 and Cry. And there's nothing inside. And there's nothing in mind. And only you. Rocket on thru the sky. It couldn't be done without dogs. It couldn't be once without us. '87 and Cry. '87 and Cry. When the days were the days were the days boys. When blue ties were for the biggy guys. Frannie dressing down for the enemy. You saw him hangin' on the enemy. And there's no one in love. And there's nowhere to scream. And only you. Race on to wonder where. It couldn't be done without dogs. It couldn't be once without us. '87 and Cry. '87 and Cry. You can't make love with money. You can't make mistakes with babies. Nothing looked good on you. That's how I liked you best. Now you're ready for the real McCoy. Deep in the heart of Cupid. Murders on the heels of love. Just the ghost of a story. Just a one dollar secret. Baby these were the sounds. Baby these were the sounds. And only you. Whisper these things aren't true. It couldn't be done with dogs. It couldn't be once without us. '87 and Cry. '87 and Cry

1682,David Bowie,Rock,There's a cry that is heard in the city. From Vivian at Pentecost Lane. A shriekin' and dancing till 4 a.m.. Another night of muscles and pain. I love you despite your convictions. That God never laughs at my jokes. I'm a young man at odds with the Bible. But I don't pretend faith never works. When we're down on our knees. Prayin' at the bus stop. Now Jesus he came in a vision. And offered you redemption from sin. I'm not sayin' that I don't believe you. But are you sure that it really was him. I've been told that it couldn've been blue cheese. Or the meal that we ate down the road. I'm a young man at odds with the Bible. But I don't pretend faith never works. When we're down on our knees. Prayin' at the bus stop

I miss your kissing and I miss your head. And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead. Just run outside in the desert heat. Make your dress all wet and send it to me. I miss your soup and I miss your bread. And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead. So spill your breakfast and drip your wine. Just wear that dress when you're dying.

The hatred of yourself. And the sufferings that conspire. To take your little body and throw it to the. fools. And the hounds that rip your flesh. Only your mind can take you out of this. Only your mind or death. I'm riding on the subway. The subway down to hell. I've finished with this journey. Oh I seem to know it well. Oh Gonna hit Crack City. Hit Crack City. Hit Crack City. Hit Crack City. Hit Crack City. Yeah.

1687,David Bowie,Rock,The tactful cactus by your window. Surveys the prairie of your room. Mobile spins to its collision. Clara puts her head between her paws. They've opened shops down West side.

1688,David Bowie,Rock,I may not always love you. But as long as there are stars above you. You'll never need to doubt it. I'll make you so sure about it. God only knows what I'd be without you.

Goodbye Mr. Ed. Some things are so big. They make no sense. Histories so small. People are so dense. Someone sees it al. Goodbye Mr. Ed. Some things are so big. They make no sense.

1690,David Bowie,Rock,Baby I dream between the blade and the tongue. Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb. We stumble and fall we stumble and fall. Skin on skin but there's heaven in. Heaven's in here. Heaven's in her. Among the twilight and star. Like a rocket to mars. Heaven in here. The first and the last are telling it all. Telling you loud but selling it small. I'm taking a swing at this shadow of mine. Crucifix hangs an' my heart's in my mouth. But it's here. Heaven's in here. Heaven's in her. Among the twilight and stars. Like a rocket to mars. Heaven's in here. Feeling it wanting. mm mm m. Heaven in. Heaven lies between your marbled thighs. The rustle of your falling gown. We stumble and fall like tragedy falls. We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here. We stumble and fall uncertain we fall. There's flesh on flesh but there's heaven in. Heaven's in here. Heaven's in here. Heaven's in here. Among the twilight and stars. Like a rocket to mars. Heaven's in here. You'll dance to my tongue. We'll dance on the sun. We're the twilight and stars. And there's heaven in here.
1691,David Bowie,Rock,There's a graveyard by the station. Where the girls wear nylon skirts and. Sandals from Hungary. The boys ride their Riga 1's. Upon the little hill. Such sadness and grief. The trees die standing. That's where we made our trysts. And struggled with our guns. Would you still love me. If the clocks could go backwards. The girls would fill with blood and. The grass would be green again. Remember the dead. They were so great. Some of them. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. Where do the boys lie. Mud mud mud. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood. But I lived a blind life. A white face in prison. But you made a life out of nothing. Now I ride my black horse. I miss you. More than you'll ever ever know. Waiting with my red eyes. And my stone heart. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. Where do the boys lie. Mud mud mud. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood. I gaze in defeat. At the stars in the night. The light in my life burnt away. There will be no tomorrow. Then you sigh in your sleep. And meaning returns with the day. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. Where do the boys lie. Mud mud mud. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood

1697,David Bowie,Rock,Some might say. Some stand in the sun. Some are blind. One puts his hand in mine. One disappears his name isn't written down. One dies on the lawn. His face turned away from it all. Isn't it evening. I forget if it's always this way. I was told it was gold to this day. I suppose it was always this way. But the memories won't quit. And they tell a story so sad. Isn't it evening. Tears running by. Shaking and terrify. Ones falling down. Nothing remains inside. Broken and cold. His faith lies upon the shore. Fading and thin. One face crushed in lavender. Isn't it evening. I forget if it's always this way. I was told it was gold to this day. I suppose it was always this way. But the memories won't quit. And they tell a story. Isn't it evening. Isn't it evening. Some are blind. One puts his hand in mine. Isn't it evening. Isn't it evening

1727,David Bowie,Rock,I forgot what my father said. I forgot what he said. I forgot what my mother said. As we lay upon your bed. A city full of flowers. A city full of rain. I got seven days to live my life. Or seven ways to die. I forgot what my brother said. I forgot what he said. I don't regret anything at all. I remember how we wept. On a bridge of violent people. I was small enough to cry. I got seven days to live my life. Or seven ways to die. Hold my face before you. Still my trembling heart. Seven days to live my life. Or seven ways to die. The gods forgot they made me. So I forget them too. I listen to the shadows. I play among their graves. My heart was never broken. My patience never tried. I got seven days to live my life. Or seven ways to die. Seven days to live my life. Or seven ways to die. Seven
1728,David Bowie,Rock,I feel like a sail-boat. Adrift on the sea. It's a brand new day. So when you gonna phone me. I could take you to heaven. I could spin you to hell. But I'll take you to New York. It's the place that I know well. Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl. Wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well. I duck and I sway - what's my line. Shoot at a full moon - what's my line. What's my line - shake it baby. Cause love is the answer. Love's talking to me. I'd scream and I'll fight for you.

The only one and all alone
1731,David Bowie,Rock,Stone love - she kneels before the grave. A brave son - who gave his life to see the slogan. That hovers between the headstone and her eyes. For they penetrate her grieving. New love - a boy and girl they talking. New words - that only they can share in. New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts. To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning. Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross a baby. Love descends on those defenseless. Idiot love will spark the fusion. Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove. All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving. Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and. Told of love - and how my God on high is. All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves. By the blindness that surrounds him. Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross a baby. Love descends on those defenseless. Idiot love will spark the fusion. Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove. All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving. Lai lai la-la la-la la-la la lai lai. La-lai la-lai la-lai lai lai lai

1739,David Bowie,Rock,Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson. Is delay just wasting my time. Looking across at Richard Rogers. Scheming dreams to blow both their minds. It's difficult you see. To give up baby. To leave a Job. When you know the moneys from day to day. All the majesty of a city landscape. All the soaring days of our lives. All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye. All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes. Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel. This stone boy watching the crawling land. Rings of flesh and the towers of iron. The steaming caves and rocks and the sand. Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson. Is delay just wasting my time. It's difficult you see. To give up baby. These summer scumholes. This goddamned starving life. All the majesty of a city landscape. All the soaring days of our lives. All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye. All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes. It's difficult you see. It's difficult you see. All the majesty of a city landscape. All the soaring days in our lives. All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye.

C'mon and get a good idea. C'mon and get it soon. I'm waiting on the fire escape. I'm not exactly well. I'm neither red nor black nor white. I'm grey and blown to hell. Tin machine. Tin machine. Make some new computer thing. That puts me on the moon. Not this psycho-time-bomb planet. Poised to meet it's maker. Shake a leg. Tin machine. Tin machine. One sick deathless duty to remain endangered species. They reach right out to touch someone. Then wash their crusty hands. Tin machine. Tin machine. Baby doll. Baby doll. Blue suede tuneless wonders. Mass confusion-faithless blues. Night that spews out watchmen. Mopping up another fortune. Fractured words and branca-sonic. Anger trapped behind locked doors. And right between the eyes. Raging raging raging. Burning in my room. C'mon and get a good idea. C'mon and get it soon. I'm waiting on the fire escape. I'm not exactly well. I'm neither red nor black nor white.

1747,David Bowie,Rock,You have just everything. But nothing at all. Now the moon is dark. Feels like pain again. You could feel my breath. You opened my eyes. For I could not see. When I met you. When I met you (you're feeling depressed). I could not speak (ou're drowning in pain). You opened my mouth (you're walking in midst). You opened my heart (you're leaving again). My spirit shows (she tore you down). The marks and stains (happens all the same). Could not exist (you were afraid). When I met you. Now it's all the same. It's all the same. The sun is gone.

Did you actually become. The center of my world. The seams of my life. The streams of daydream. Like the wounds of a friend. Another the kiss of a foe. The pack of a blackened eye. A life or the crown. When I met you. I could not speak. How I met you. Then I met you. My spirit grows. My kind of truth. Could not exist. When I met you. How it's all the same. It's all the same. The sun is gone. It's all the same. But when I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. I was the walking dead. I was kicked in the head. It was such a time. It was such a time. I was crushed inside. I was torn inside. When I met you. When I met you. I was too insane. Could not trust a thing. I was off my head. I was filled with truth. It was not god's truth. Before I met you
1748,David Bowie,Rock,In my life I've never stopped to worry about a thing. Opened up and shouted out and never tried to see. Wondering if I'd done wrong (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu). Will this depression last for long. Won't you tell me. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same. Time was on our side and I had everything to gain. Let it be like yesterday (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu). Please let me have happy days. Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do. Didn't have no money and they always told the truth. Daddy didn't have no toys (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu). And Mummy didn't need no boys. Won't you tell me. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play. But let's face it things are so much easier today. Guess you need some bringing down (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu). Get your feet back on the ground. Won't you tell me. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone.
1749,David Bowie,Rock,Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand. Just when the best things in life are gone. I look into your eyes. There's no smoke without fire. You're exactly who I want to be with. Without you. What would I do. And when I'm willing to call it a day. Just when I won't take another chance. I hold your hand. There's no smoke without fire. Woman I love you. Without you. What would I do
1750,David Bowie,Rock,As soon as you're born they make you feel small. By giving you no time instead of it all. Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. They hurt you at home and they hit you at school. They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool. Till you're so fucking crazy you can't fallow their rules. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years. Ah then they expect you to pick a career. When you can't really function you're so full of fear. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV. And you think you're so clever and classless and free. But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. There's room at the top they are telling you still. But first you must smile as you kill. But if you want to be like the folks on the hill. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. If you want to be a hero well just follow me. If you want to be a hero well just follow me.
1751,David Bowie,Rock,Where's the pain in the violent night?. I'm depressed by the grill. I stay over many years. I should have thought of that. For the love of the money. Like a black-hearted vile thing. It's the nature of being. It's too many lonely nights. I can't tell bad from wrong. I can't pass you by. Too exchanging. You've been around. But you've changed me. When the flesh meets the spirit world. Where the traffic is thin. I slip from a vacant view. I should have thought of that. And the sound of tomorrow. Like a black-hearted vile thing. Like the silence of tension. It's too many lonely nights. I can't tell good from bad. I can't pass you by. Too exchanging. You've been around. But you've changed me. You've been around. Can't pass you by. You've been around. But you've changed me. Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!. Too exchanging. You've been around. but you've changed me. You've been around. can't pass you by. You've been around. but you've changed me. You've been around. can't pass you by. You've been around.
1752,David Bowie,Rock,Ziggy played guitar. jamming good with Weird and Gilly. And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand. But made it too far. Became the special man. then we were Ziggy's band. Ziggy really sang. screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo. Like some cat from Japan. he could lick 'em by smiling. He could leave 'em to hang. Came on so loaded man. well hung and snow white tan. So where were the spiders while. the fly tried to break our balls. Just the beer light to guide us. So we bitched about his fans and. should we crush his sweet hands?. Ziggy played for time. Jiving us that we were voodoo. The kids were just crass. he was the nazz. With God given ass. He took it all too far but. boy could he play guitar. Making love with his ego. Ziggy sucked up into his mind. Like a leper messiah. When the kids had killed the man. I had to break up the band. Ziggy played gui... tar

Don't look me in the eye more than you need to. Don't try to say goodbye if I don't want to. Don't say how proud you are. And say I'm far away. and take along your. and say a word. and I can say fade away. Felipe Lara da Silva 8)
1821,Dido,Rock,And before I start the day. I have a glimpse of how I used to feel. When we drove all night and laughed all day. Thinking nothing can go wrong. And now our hands are full and walking in the dark. I don't know what's below or what's above. But it doesn't matter now. Don't look back. Don't look back. Let's runaway. Then tomorrow won't be the same. Let's go away. Then today won't feel the same. Don't look up and don't look left or right. Trust me now and we'll be fine. I'll take your fear and send it out to sea. And you'll forget every little thing you've seen. And it doesn't matter now. Don't look back. Let's runaway. Then tomorrow won't be the same. Let's go away. Then today won't feel the same. Let's runaway. Then tomorrow won't be the same. Let's go away. Then today won't feel the same. Let's runaway. Then tomorrow won't feel the same. Won't feel the same
1822,Dido,Rock,I take it by your silence. That I'm free to walk out the door. By the look in your eyes I can tell. You don't think I'll be back for more. Try to think of a world. Where you could stay. And these safe hands could go. Take your heart above the water. Wherever I choose to go. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No freedom without love. Even when you don't see me. Even when you don't hear. I'll be flying low below the sun. And you'll feel it all out here. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No freedom without love. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No freedom without love. I'm standing here in silence. The world in front of me. Holding you in my hand. And seeing as you'd see. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No freedom without love. No freedom without love
1823,Dido,Rock,I have returned to northern skies. Where summer hasn't touched. The clouds that pass above. I have returned to the sombre greys. Of days too early to come. And too hurried to stay. I have left a million stars. And an ocean light and clearly blue. I have left the warmth of the sun. And a million adventures. Not yet begun. For once there was beauty here for me. Under the wide northern skies. And once there was magic here for me. Under the wide northern skies. I saw trees as green. And this dark as blue. Heartbreak and poetry. With deeper roots. But now I know this is lonely country. And it leads me only back to the sea. For once there was beauty here for me. Under the wide northern skies. And once there was magic here for me. Under the wide northern skies...
1824,Dido,Rock,Coming back from Paris on the train. I really didn't care if the journey took all day. Try to turn the pages of my magazine. Whilst trying to keep a hold of your hand and. Ordering a coffee that I wouldn't ever drink. Just to keep you and Paris on my mind. Just to keep you and Paris on my mind. I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you. At Waterloo we went our separate ways. When I got in my cab. I didn't turn and wave. I didn't go to work. Just went to bed. Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind. Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind. I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you. I phoned your office this afternoon. They said they hadn't heard anything from you. It's been seven days without a word. I have to keep you and Paris on my mind. I have to keep you and Paris on my mind. I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you. Going back to Paris on the train. Raining and without you it's not the same. I have to do this journey one more time. Just to keep you and Paris on my mind. Just to keep you and Paris on my mind. I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you. The last time I saw you. The last time I saw you. The last time I saw you
1825,Dido,Rock,I climbed a mountain. Not knowing that I had. Thought it was just a road from a to b. I took no protection. Not much of anything. Just went as I was. Looking in windows. And playing songs. And knocking on doors. And I was not scared. I just enjoyed the sights. Kept myself to myself. There I was. Sitting on the roof of the world. There I was. There I was. Not knowing how I got there. Or how to leave. Everyone says. I was lucky to have got there. As not many can. But truth be told. I was saved. By the love. Of a good man. Who came and got me. [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/sitting-on-the-roof-of-the-world-lyrics-dido.html ]. And bought me down. From on. Up there. I'd be lying if I didn't say. I missed it now and then. But I have no wish to go back there. There I was. Sitting on the roof of the world. There I was. With all the gods. Not knowing how I got there. Or how to leave. People say. What's so special about being back here. With everyone so close. But that's the point. I don't want to be different. I just want to fit in. There I was. There I was. Sitting on the roof of the world. There I was. With all the gods. Not knowing how I got there. Or how to leave
1826,Dido,Rock,We can make it rain again. I'd feel like I belong. Let's make it cold again. I'm not ready and it's wrong. We can put the outdoor chairs back in and lock the door. Go back to walking all heads down and put our coats back on. The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you. We can stay at home and draw the blinds and light a fire. Pull the covers high and go to sleep early for hours. Don't want to be too hot and there's no way to cool down. Don't want to sit outside all night or even leave the house. The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you. I don't want to sit and drink in parks and watch the sun go down. Don't want to put my feet in water and lie back in the grass. I don't want to watch the plains go by or hold anybody's hand. The summer's come too soon and I can't come back to you. The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you. And if the sun would go down. Stop reminding us how. If we ever had a chance. I don't by now
1827,Dido,Pop,I wanna wake up. With your weight by my side. And I wanna think that. You look good as you rise. And I wanna turn to you. Turn around by your side. And I wanna think. But not to say. Let me face the sound and fury. Let me face hurricanes. And I wanna see you. As you walk through the door. Time will make us. Some ways less and some ways more. And I wanna talk of nothing. As the world passes by. And I wanna think. But not to say. Let me face the sound and fury. Let me face hurricanes. Let me not turn away from happiness or pain. Just not to run away in my heart and in my head. Let me face. Hurricanes. Hurricanes. Hurricanes. Hurricanes. Hurricanes. Hurricanes. Let me face. The sound and fury. Let me face. Hurricanes. Let me face. The sound and fury. Let me face. Hurricanes. (Hurricanes). (Hurricanes). (Hurricanes)
1828,Dido,Pop,I take it by your silence. That I'm free to walk out the door. By the look in your eyes I can tell. You don't think I'll be back for more. Try to think of a world. Where you could stay.

No freedom without love. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No freedom without love. I'm standing here in silence. The world in front of me. Holding you in my hand. And seeing as you'd see. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No freedom without love. No freedom without love
1829,Dido,Pop,If you're feeling low and lost today. You're probably doing too much again. You spend all your hours just rushing around. Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?. Slow down my love. You're confusing me and. If your feeling stressed. Just try calling. You spend your time waiting for anyone to see. Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?. You should stop for a while. You will find me standing by. Over here at the side of your life. I'd like to hold you still. Remind you of all you've missed. If you have a little time to have a little time that is. Why do you still run. When you could walk with me. Life will pass you by. When you move this quickly. What can you see when you're spinning around. Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?. You should stop for a while. You will find me standing by. Over here at the side of your life. I'd like to hold you still. Remind you of all you've missed. If you have time that is. If you let me listen. I'll make you feel clear. Spend your time waiting for anyone to see. You should stop for a while. You will find me standing by. Over here at the side of your life. I'd like to hold you still. Remind you of all you've missed. If you have a little time to have a little time that is. You should stop for a while. You will find me standing by. Over here at the side of your life. I'd like to hold you still. Remind you of all you've missed. If you have a little time to have a little time that is
1830,Dido,Pop,All the pictures on the wall. The sand lying on the floor. The bed upstairs still unmade. The dust float in the light. The people just left. All laughter and mess. Forgetting this and that. And rushing back. The front door open. The music still playing in one room. Down the hall. Towels on the floor. And then it's quiet. Just the bees and birds. The summer haze. Of the trees. And the air. Feeds it all. Feeds it all. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. The day before we went to war. The day before we went to war. We can all feel it. All the parasols and kids at play. The sea so still and calm. Blue as the cloudless sky. Just the gentle hum. Of the summer's goings on. Broken by the sudden rush. Of two planes. Flying low and fast. Into the sun. Into the sun. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. The day before we went to war. The day before we went to war. We can all feel it. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. The day before we went to war. The day before we went to war. The day before we went to war
1831,Dido,Pop,A young gentleman came riding past. On a snow blue winters day. He asked to drink by our fire. And I was pleased to let him stay. He drank there quietly for a while. And then he turned and said to me. Your eyes are green. Like summer grass. Your lips are red. Like a fresh cut rose. Your hair is soft. Like an Irish stream. And your voice. Is filled with sweet beauty. And the last words I heard him say. Were I shall return. For you. My love. On Christmas Day. And the night will come. But I won't sleep. As I watch the stars that lead him. I cannot place where he is. But still my heart goes with him. I'm saving all my Sunday clothes. For the day that I'll be leaving. Father knows. My sister knows. And my friends. They're happy for me. And the priest he says. You should thank God. For the blessing. Of such beauty. And the last words. I heard him say. Were I shall return. For you. My love. On Christmas Day. I shall return. For you. My love. On Christmas Day. (On Christmas Day). (I shall return for you my love). And the last words. I heard him say. Were the last words. I ever. Heard him say. I shall return. For you. My love. On Christmas Day. I swear. I will return. On Christmas Day. And yes. I shall return. On Christmas Day. I shall return. For you. On Christmas Day. My love. I will return. On Christmas Day. I shall return. My love. On Christmas Day. On Christmas Day

1839,Dido,Pop,Let's pretend that we'll be here tomorrow. And I'll try for you to be a little more on time. I know you need to say you know you've let me down. But you haven't and it's hard to talk with people all around. Please don't say how proud you are. Lets do the things we normally do. I'll say see you later. You'll sing a line or two. From your rebel songs sung out of tune. Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to. Lets forget that we're here and make some plans. We'll go for walks. Sit together on the bench we always sat. I'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will you. Don't try to stay awake. I'm feeling tired too. This is just another day. Let's do the things we normally do. I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two. From your rebel songs sung out of tune. Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to. Armored cars and tanks and guns came to take away our sons.

1846,Diego Perin,Rock,Se eu freio. Não bato no muro. Se acelero. Eu atravesso. Se eu me seguro. Eu não caio. Mas se eu salto. Eu flutuo. . Se eu fico no trilho. Eu tô seguro. Descarrilho. Corro o mundo. Se eu me calo. É ato falho. Se escancaro. Eu tenho tudo. Coleção de sonhos na estante
1847,Dirty Pretty Things,Rock,We could throw ourselves in a road. But receive no comfort from street lights. Why not come in for a jamens and escape life?. We're idle in the mean time. Aristocrats and architects with broken dreams. Well I say the dead sea is dying. You say you're going underground for a while. Well we all need to be recognised for something. Not sure if the devil's eyes are blue. Work and days of underpaid still hold the key. I see this place from my window. It goes on the corner like the rest. There are the buzzards and the crows. Making eyes of a sea. Self obesessed. Now if commandment 11 is don't get caught. Then 12 must be don't ever tell. Then ask yourself do you believe you'll go to hell?. [My mate went to the crossroads to see the devil]. He never showed and if he says that I believe. I hear the place from my window. Call me like a lighthouse to the sea. There swarm the buzzards and the crows. Swirling wide talking wise and there's me. You and I hanging around. Lads who've got childish names. Scissors we cut it out. Shining before by the waves. I need to be recognised. 'Cause we could be self-assured. We could be happy indoors. I know this place from my window. I trip out and fall to the ground down below. Hoods up for the buzzards and the crows. Who believe in the void of themselves. Still believe in the void of themselves. And all the trees and animals of mountains green

1851,Dirty Pretty Things,Rock,This is where the truth begins. Where teardrops glance the sallow skin. You lose your will. And I can lend you mine. The westway wall’s. So tall and bleak. Reflect the words we dare not speak. By the bottle’s end. We may have done our time. What you want is to stay away from People like me. Who twist most everything they see. And leave the grey old world behind you. So sow it up kid have some clout. We’ll do some wine and fall about. The sun will shine again tomorrow. Look beyond the parapet. We are just bums lest you forget. We can beg steal and borrow. Well you said the pills would sort me out. Embolden me against the. Manifestations of fear and doubt. I just forgot who I used to be. So now I’m strung somewhere between a dream. And humdrum day to day routine. A laurel wreath from the door to my heart. What you wants to wash your face and try to breathe. Forget your mind and shut your eyes so that you can see. And leave the gray old world behind you. So sow it up kid have no doubt. We’ll go to mine and have it out. The sun will shine again tomorrow. For all the friends you've ever met. Some you’ll love and some forget. Just hold on for tomorrow. So here’s to now. And all of us of course. The hearts we tried. Make a brand new start. Let the fabric never tear us apart. And some day when. We're in the cold. Here's a semblance. We can hope so. The proposal. And put it on your heart. For me. So now I move. And if you’re in. It wouldn’t hurt just to give it a try and win. Don’t forget who you're meant to be. What you wants to get a bike and do wheelies. I bet you can’t do em half as good as me. Throw it out. When it's over it's over. So sow it up kid have some clout. We’ll have some wine and sulk about. How the sun will shine tomorrow. For all the friends you’ve not yet met. Some would die for you I’ll bet. So hold on for tomorrow. So sow it up kid have some clout. We'll go to mine and fuck about. The sun will shine again. For all friends you've not yet met. Some would die for you you I bet. So hold on for tomorrow. This is where the truth begins. For more than seven deadly sins. You lose your will. I may have hurt you're mind
1852,Disturbed,Rock,Now!. I can feel the animal inside. My resolve is weakening. Pounding on the doors of my mind. It's nearly overpowering. I cannot begin to describe. The hunger that I feel again. Run if you intend to survive. For the beast is coming to life. Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight. Death approaches on this night. For the animal's soul is mine. We will be completed right before your eyes. I have no control this time. And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight. I can feel the calling again. The primal need is filling me. Changes are about to begin. And now my blood is boiling. I can see the fear in your eyes. But you can't bring yourself to scream. Time to shed the mortal disguise. For the beast is coming to life. Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight. Death approaches on this night. For the animal's soul is mine. We will be completed right before your eyes. I have no control this time. And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight. We begin the hunt tonight. Til the power courses the creatures take flight. When the kill is close and I will be satisfied. For the smell of fear tonight. Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied. You're mine. For the animal's soul is mine. We will be completed right before your eyes. I have no control this time. And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight. For the animal's soul is mine. And the world around will never hear your cries. An unholy crime. And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight.. .

1868,Dog Eat Dog,Rock,Back in the old days when gangsters were all the rage. And crime was the front page of news and TV..... A group known to no one who's blows were all low ones. The cops had shit to go on they had no leads..... Drive by shootings. Murders at will.... Pay for protection. Or have yourself killed.... Gangbusters.... Guys like Al Capone who loved being unknown. Made themselves at home and still got away.... The law couldn't catch him or none of his hit men. So he died in prison for taxes unpaid.... Screw prohibition. Crimes go unsolved. Elliot Ness. Couldn't wrap up the mob.... Hey Ho- Who the gangbusters. Hey yo- You the gangbusters. That's Right- We the gangbusters.... Some say crime don't pay but they didn't feel that way. And so I would have to say that I do agree.... The gangbusters in the past proved they were there to last. By knife or shotgun blast for the world to see. Gangbusters.

1870,Dog Eat Dog,Rock,Could I fly around the world. If my wings were really broke. And see so clearly. Drowning in grey smoke. I've got to stay quiet. But there's so much to say. If I could feel my arms. I'd push it all away. I know there is a future. And the best is still to come. When all I have are feelings. Why am I always.... Wishing that a moment. Was really like an hour. The every penny that I earn. Could balance out the dollar. Something that's spent on patience. Would make me patron saint. You know I might be ordained today. I guess I'll have to wait. Hurry up and wait. Gotta break it out. Gonna turn the lights on. See what's there for me. Take a look around. With an open shutter. There's a world to see.
1871,Dog Eat Dog,Rock,You tried out for the high school team. So you would have some childhood dreams. That you and your father could share. Football coach said you're too small. Don't even think of basketball. You knew you were destined to fail. Went to the track meet. You wanna be an athlete (sore loser). Get back in your seat they said. Go to the dugout. Three strikes you stuck out (sore loser). And home runs flew over your head. Looking down on rock n' roll. And you dreamed of scoring goals. You're saving those dreams for your bed. Thought it was cool to be a jock. You ended up a rent-a-cop. A dozen donuts in your hand. You're a loser. A sore loser. Now it seems the tables turned. The game of life you should have learned. So try using some of your brains. All your high school friends are stars. Driving really fancy cars. The irony drives you insane.
1872,Dog Eat Dog,Rock,Start off the day say you wanna play. You don't wanna pay but you wanna stay. Do what you want when you wanna do it. Could of had more but you went and blew it. Now the time has come time to have some fun. Won't see the sun until I'm done. There's one thing before we begin. Get on the table and let me see some skin. Back to the story you know you really bore me. Hard enough to live when you're always horny. I like you you love me. Simple as that it's gotta be. I'm givin' you a chance you better take it. An orgasm you fake it. Something you should know before I'm good to go. We're gonna have sex I gotta see a show.
1873,Dog Eat Dog,Rock,I don't even hear what you say. It's all about what you do. You think you're the mack. I'll tell you a fact. No-one gives a fuck about you. What it is. What is was. And what you always will be. Think. You think you're my friend. You ain't my friend. I hear you talking about respect and clout. You never get a bit. A front or a back. We're gonna smack. Time to flip the script on you kid.
1874,Dog Eat Dog,Rock,Ear to the ground keep one eye on the clock. The crew that's rising up this time. ain't the N.K.O.T.B.. Don't wanna take a number not gonna. stand in line.

What am I feeling?. Crédito: Alice Petry

The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She's the girl I'd stay home for. If I had the courage I'd ring her bell. But if she answered what story would I tell. My window's become her picture frame. But this painting doesn't even have a name. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She's the girl I'd stay home for. She doesn't know that I'm breathing. She doesn't know that I'm alive. She doesn't know what I'm dreaming. When I see that she's turned out her lights. And does she see me like I see her. More than just the boy next door. More than just the boy next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door.

1886,Drake Bell,Pop,Wake up. It's time to get your things together. And drive away. Breathe out. Future days will treats you better. That's what they say. Another day. Gone without a sound. But it's okay. If you turn away. And feel the memories bringin' you down. Chorus:. And in the end. Are you stronger?. Do you no longer?. Need to recover. And where have you been. Since it's been over?. Over my shoulder. Under my skin. Will you ever return there again.... Wake up. The monsters in your head have left you. All to yourself. It's all right.

1887,Drake Bell,Pop,Until all the things I feel. Replace all the things you did. I will remain a stranger. In every place you hid. Don't ask me to be your hero. Those stories are never real. And if I fall from danger. Too close to the way I feel. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. The things it takes to make up. May seem to bring me down. It's not that I don't want you. You're someone like me around. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. I wonder if you know. The truth is far too cold. But if I could frame your soul. I'd never let go. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all behind. By larita bell

Can't you see there's so much I do. You keep my head spinning around. It's hard to keep my feet on the ground. Talk to you in metaphor. I know the end babe. I've been there before. Oh how I want to be your friend. But I don't want this love to end. Can't you see I'm in love with you. Can't you see there's so much I do. You keep my head spinning around.

The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She's the girl I'd stay home for. If I had the courage I'd ring her bell. But if she answered what story would I tell. My window's become her picture frame. But this painting doesn't even have a name. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She's the girl I'd stay home for. She doesn't know that I'm breathing. She doesn't know that I'm alive. She doesn't know what I'm dreaming. When I see that she's turned out her lights. And does she see me like I see her. More than just the boy next door. More than just the boy next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. The girl next door is not the girl next door. She doesn't know that I'm alive

1915,Drake Bell,Rock,Wake up. It's time to get your things together. And drive away. Breathe out. Future days will treats you better. That's what they say. Another day. Gone without a sound. But it's okay. If you turn away. And feel the memories bringin' you down. Chorus:. And in the end. Are you stronger?. Do you no longer?. Need to recover. And where have you been. Since it's been over?. Over my shoulder. Under my skin. Will you ever return there again.... Wake up. The monsters in your head have left you. All to yourself. It's all right.

1916,Drake Bell,Rock,Until all the things I feel. Replace all the things you did. I will remain a stranger. In every place you hid. Don't ask me to be your hero. Those stories are never real. And if I fall from danger. Too close to the way I feel. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. The things it takes to make up. May seem to bring me down. It's not that I don't want you. You're someone like me around. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all behind. I wonder if you know. The truth is far too cold. But if I could frame your soul. I'd never let go. I feel what I used to fear. I know what I need to hear. I can't keep wasting time. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all. Why can't we just leave it all behind. By larita bell

Oh how I want to be your friend. But I don't want this love to end. Can't you see I'm in love with you. Can't you see there's so much I do. You keep my head spinning around.

1927,Drake Bell,Rock,Strange how things can change. How your consciousness can fade. Reason can compete. With the drug that shares your name. And there you are on cue where the light falls. Waving at strangers wearing your name out. You are not yourself here. You are someone else dear. Aren't you terrific?. Aren't you terrific now?. All the world applauds. To the popular tricks you choose. Who are they to stop. When your hands are clapping too. And you'd believe that. It's an achievement. Scratching them where they. Have no feeling. You are not yourself here. You are someone else dear. Aren't you terrific?. Aren't you terrific now?. It was you who spoke out when no one heard (oh yeah). You're not as pure as you were. Vanity hangs you by threads. And right now I wish some things were undone. It's as natural as it is fun. This is not the time to give up yourself to anyone. You are not yourself here. You are someone else dear. Aren't you terrific?. Aren't you terrific?. If you saw yourself here. You would be amazed dear. Are you terrific. Finally terrific now

How can you be so sure when you feel when. you know that You're changing all the time. Oh. You said we could make it if we wished upon a star. And always be together no matter where we are. And I told you only yesterday wed always feel this way. And now you want to tell me. You're feeling different today
1929,Drake Bell,Rock,Watchin' TV everybody's takin' sides. They all got nothin' to say. It's all about the spin. It's all about the spin. On the surface everybody seems right.

1931,Drake Bell,Rock,It's just another day. Like any other day. Til I opened up the shades. And it was black as night. And I don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. Was it something that I said. Something that I did. That got inside your head. Made you walk away. 'Cause I don't know what I've done. But I woke up on the wrong side of the sun. I still don't have a reason. And I hope that I'm dreamin'. 'Cause it looks like you're leavin' me now. My world won't stop turnin'. And left me here learnin'. To live with the darknes I've found.

1932,Drake Bell,Rock,Driving back from God knows when. How'd you stay so long in Bloomington ?. Trying to see what it is about him. Then you find you're on your own. Trying to find a place to hang your coat. Can't you see that all your birds have flown away ?. Yesterday's Fool. Comes running back to you. Yesterday's﻿ Fool. Trying to play it cool. Dropping out of school. Breaking all the rules. But who is fooling who ?﻿. Patterns never seem to change. Same old heartache by a﻿ different name. You start out happy but when it all falls down again. You can come and cry to me. That's not the way that it's supposed to be. Tell me when you'll finally see that I am. Yesterday's Fool. Comes running back to you. Yesterday's Fool. Trying to play it cool. Dropping out﻿ of school. Breaking all the rules. But who is fooling who ?
1933,Drive,Rock,Perco tempo. E faço coisas que você parece nem notar. Tantos planos e outra vez eu vou embora sem saber o que falar. Talvez eu seja só um novo amigo. talvez eu queira te levar comigo. Pra bem longe daqui. Onde nem o céu seja o limite. Esperei o tempo. Falar por mim. Coisas que eu não sei dizer. Olhando pra você. Sei que vejo. Você de um jeito que ninguém consegue enxergar. Tantos planos. E outra vez eu vou embora sem saber o que falar. Talvez eu seja só um novo amigo. Talvez eu queira te levar comigo. Pra bem longe daqui. Onde nem o céu seja o limite. Esperei o tempo.

1934,Drive,Rock,Pensa em mim como um amigo. Algo assim. Afinal meu atrevimento é natural. Deixa eu ser o escravo dessa maldição. Pra compreender que as meninas tem maior intuição. Olho pro céu e vou. Pintando o céu de azul. Esse é meu sonho azul. Eu quero ver o seu. paladar ansioso pra experimentar. Brisa vem me trazendo o frescor do mar. Deixa eu ser. O herói que vai te resgatar. Pra comprovar que as meninas tem melhor educação. Olho pro céu e vou. Pintando o céu de azul. Esse é meu sonho azul. Eu quero ver o seu. Olho pro céu e vou. Pintando o céu de azul. Esse é meu sonho azul. Eu quero ver o seu
1935,Drive,Rock,Parece estupidez tudo acabar assim. Quem sabe pra você não seja como foi pra mim. Não paro pra pensar no que pode acontecer. Você não está em meu lugar por isso não vai entender. Outra vez alguém se vai te dando as costas sem olhar pra. trás.... Esse medo que te afasta e faz você ficar cada vez mais só.... Nem sempre foi assim. Eu volto pra buscar o que tirou de mim.... Ainda pode me levar pra perto de você. Onde eu não quero estar. Não sei o que dizer embora tenha tanto pra falar. Outra vez alguém se vai te dando as costas sem olhar pra. trás.... Esse medo que te afasta e faz você ficar cada vez mais só.... Outra vez alguém se vai te dando as costas sem olhar pra. trás.... Esse medo que te afasta e faz você ficar cada vez mais só...
1936,Drive,Rock,Falam da nossa geração. Quem é você?Quem são seus pais?. Querem dizer quem devo ser. Sabem o que me satisfaz. Eu não quero mais viver assim. Aqui não é mais o meu lugar. Se eu não fizer quem vai fazer por mim. Você não precisa me escutar. Pode ser mais um dia ruim. Não vai durar pro resto da vida. Pode estar escrito assim. Pode estar morta ou só estar ferida. Por trás de tudo existe alguem. Querendo sempre um pouco mais. Do que eu posso oferecer. Das coisas que eu corro atrás
1937,Drive,Rock,Vamos todos escutar o que eles têm pra nos dizer. Somos fáceis de manipular por quanto tempo ainda vamos crer?. Que um dia isso tudo vai mudar. que o que eles dizem vai acontecer. Num mar de lama vão nos afogar e a gente ainda finge. que não vê. Quais são os seus ideais? O que é preciso fazer?. Quando ninguém se importa mais.... Outro ano se passou e uma resposta a gente espera ter. Vejo que nada se modificou em pouco tempo vamos perceber. Que bem no fundo todos são iguais e nada tem pra nos oferecer. É do dinheiro que estão atrás. e um triste filme é o que nos vamos ver. Quais são os seus ideais? O que é preciso fazer?. Quando ninguém se importa mais.... Ordem e progresso revolução. Tantas promessas nenhuma solução. Quais são os seus ideais?
1938,Drive,Rock,Deixa eu ver como será enfim uma vida inteira sem você. Deixa eu me acostumar assim a não ter nada do que era meu. Sei que será difícil pra nós dois e que o tempo pode nos afastar. E assim eu vou deixando pra depois. tudo o que um dia veio pra me salvar. Sem querer eu fui gostar de ti e ainda não sei explicar. O porquê que tanto eu senti quando você mostrou. não se importar. Dizer adeus foi como mergulhar e me afogar. num mar de desilusão. Nos olhos teus só vejo um triste olhar castanho escuro. cheio de solidão. Ouooooo. Deixa eu ver como será enfim uma vida inteira sem você. Deixa eu me acostumar assim a não ter nada do que era meu. Coração de pedra que parece se despedaçar. E no fim alguém me leva pra bem longe do que me faz lembrar. Lembrar... de ti Uoooo. Eu sei que errei tentando te acertar.
1939,Drive,Rock,É tão dificil perceber. Que esse medo só te leva. Pra longe de mim. Eu quero e tem que ser assim ??. O que você chama de amor. Não pode me satisfazer é preciso. Ir até o fim. Tem coisas que não se pode fugir. Tem coisas que não se pode fugir. Você nasceu com esse dom. De me fazer voltar a ser um garoto outra vez. E tudo vai ser sempre assim. Nunca pensei em te dizer. Que o que falta em você. É saber o que falta em mim. Tem coisas que não se pode fugir (4x)

1941,Drive,Rock,O que te faz ficar assim?. Quando as palavras não conseguem explicar. E com alguém é bem melhor. O equilíbrio é tão difícil de alcançar. Dentro de nós nasceu a força de vontade. Para vencer. Eu acredito na igualdade. Onde estiver escrevo o que não foi escrito. Quando não conseguir dormir. Pense em algo que te faça relaxar. Pense que estou por aí. Ansioso pra pode me derramar. Sobre você. Vivendo um dia após o outro. Bem devagar. Não quero muito nem tão pouco. Só o ideal. Eu acredito no impossível. Dentro de nós.

E assim te encontro sozinha ao meu lado. Me pedindo pra ficar sem pensar

E o que eu vou ganhar?. Por ser um bom cidadão. Pago minhas contas sigo uma religião. Tudo que envolve e fascina. Funciona a álcool e também com gasolina. Verdade ou mentira? paixão amor e sexo.

1945,Drive,Rock,Lihatlah dirimu terus berjalan. Dalam mimpi indah kita berdua. Kau tahu tak mungkin tapi kau ingin teruskan. Dirimu dan aku tak mungkin bersama. Pergilah sayangku kau tak butuhkan aku. Lanjutkan kisah hidupmu. Pergilah kasihku cintaku bersamamu. Bahagia selalu untukmu. Tak selalu kau dapatkan yang kau inginkan.

1946,Drive,Rock,Outra vez o sol insiste em me cegar. Eu já nem sei como acordei nesse lugar. A noite parecia me levar. Pessoas tão vazias a me rodear. Mas a festa estava mesmo boa. Que eu quase não podia ouvir. A solidão que em mim ecoa. Um beijo pra me distrair. Cantando pra comemorar. De novo tudo que eu já vi. E o teu sorriso como antes. Me diz pra onde ir. E a música te faz dançar. De um jeito que faz sentir. Que o tempo para nesse instante. E eu volto a me trair. Quer saber? Não ligo pra o que vão falar. Se eu já ganhei a fama de não me importar. Eu digo tudo que você quer escutar. Mas quando acordo só quero que você se vá. Pra o mais distante da minha vida. Que você possa caminhar. Assim encontro uma saída. Pra falta que me faz amar. Cantando pra comemorar. De novo tudo que eu já vi. E o teu sorriso como antes. Me diz pra onde ir. E a música te faz dançar. De um jeito que faz sentir. Que o tempo para nesse instante. E eu volto a me trair. Eu vou olhar pra todos os lados. Vou encontrar inocentes culpados. Eu não preciso de motivos pra sair daqui. Melhor correr pra ver mais de perto. E esquecer o que não deu certo. Eu deixo a sorte me levar pra onde eu devo ir. Cantando pra comemorar. De novo tudo que eu já vi. E o teu sorriso como antes. Me diz pra onde ir. E a música te faz dançar. De um jeito que faz sentir. Que o tempo para nesse instante. E eu volto a me trair
1947,Drive,Rock,Não esqueça de me perguntar. Se eu sou alguém que você pode confiar. Se eu não vou te abandonar sem dar motivos. E dizer que agora somos bons amigos. Outra vez eu vou embora sem olhar pra trás. Sem saber se o que deixei podia ser bem mais. Que sonhei mas acho que o amor não é pra mim. Vou ficar e viver sozinho até o fim. Sim é hora de recomeçar. Aprender que a vida às vezes pode lhe tirar. Quem você pensou em confiar os seus segredos. Te levou o amor e a fé deixando apenas medos. Outra vez eu vou embora sem olhar pra trás. Sem saber se o que deixei podia ser bem mais. Que sonhei mas acho que o amor não é pra mim. Vou ficar e viver. Vou ficar e viver. Vou ficar e viver sozinho até o fim. Vou ficar (Sozinho).

Deixa pra lá. Acho que logo o dia vai passar. Tudo que foi e não existe mais. Sei que um dia algo entre nós. Ira mudar. Mas acho que até lá tudo vai. Ficar como está. Quanto tempo faz.

De longe eu observava seus lábios que chamavam por mim. Faltam dois segundos pra te conquistar. E você parece estar afim. Foram poucas frases antes do primeiro beijo. Que eu nunca mais vou esquecer. Pra você pode ter sido apenas um momento. Que com o tempo vai desaparecer

É do dinheiro que estão atrás. e um triste filme é o que nos vamos ver. Quais são os seus ideais? O que é preciso fazer?. Quando ninguém se importa mais.... Ordem e progresso revolução. Tantas promessas nenhuma solução. Quais são os seus ideais?
1961,Drive,Rock,Hora certa pra chegar. A incerteza vai me deixar falhar. Tão poucos passos. Minhas pernas não conseguem dar. Acho melhor esperar. Mais uma dose e a minha chance vai passar. Outro segundo. Não posso mais esperar. Eu quero te dizer. Que às vezes penso em você. Não posso mais pensar. No que eu tenho pra falar. Já não importa. Se você me quer ou não. Chegou a hora de sair dessa solidão. Sei que tento não lembrar. Daquilo tudo que eu te fiz acreditar. Às vezes penso se não vai ser bem melhor assim. Te devolver pra mim. Mais uma dose e a minha chance vai passar. Outro segundo. Não posso mais esperar. Eu quero te dizer. Que às vezes penso em você. Não posso mais pensar. No que eu tenho pra falar. Já não me importa. Se você me quer ou não. Chegou a hora de sair dessa solidão. Eu quero te dizer. Às vezes penso em você. Não posso mais pensar. No que eu tenho pra falar. Já não importa. Se você me quer ou não. Chegou a hora de sair dessa solidão
1962,Drive,Rock,Só agora eu percebi o quanto custa acreditar. num sonho que não pôde vingar. você foi como a luz do sol que veio pra iluminar. a noite que parecia não ter fim. E só nós mesmos poderiamos. mudar isso tudo. O segredo e a promessa se quebrou. E só nós mesmos poderiamos. mudar o nosso mundo. Eu preciso te ter mais uma vez. O seu corpo tão jovem sem medo de se perder. Eu não consigo aceitar que é longa estrada que trilhamos. juntos. não nos levou a lugar algum. Do mesmo jeito que chegou foi embora me dizendo tenha. cuidado pra não se machucar
1963,Drive,Rock,Perco tempo. E faço coisas que você parece nem notar. Tantos planos e outra vez eu vou embora sem saber o que falar. Talvez eu seja só um novo amigo. talvez eu queira te levar comigo. Pra bem longe daqui. Onde nem o céu seja o limite. Esperei o tempo. Falar por mim. Coisas que eu não sei dizer. Olhando pra você. Sei que vejo. Você de um jeito que ninguém consegue enxergar. Tantos planos. E outra vez eu vou embora sem saber o que falar. Talvez eu seja só um novo amigo. Talvez eu queira te levar comigo. Pra bem longe daqui. Onde nem o céu seja o limite. Esperei o tempo. Falar por mim. Coisas que eu não sei dizer. Olhando pra você. Esperei o tempo. Falar por mim. Coisas que eu não sei dizer. Olhando pra você
1964,Drive,Rock,Por que não fui capaz? Quando aprendemos a mentir?. O que você deseja mais? Por que escolhemos ser assim?. No fim somos todos iguais.. Quanto tempo se passou? Quem vai cuidar dos nossos pais?. Será que existe mesmo um Deus? Porque você ficou pra trás?. Sem mais eu não consigo entender.... Se vamos todos terminar num mesmo céu. Tantas batalhas pra ganhar nenhum troféu.. Será que no fim das contas eu não soube dar valor?. O que devo confessar? Quantos crimes cometi?. Quanto custa pra te amar? Quais as drogas que ingeri?. Enfim isso eu não vou te dizer. Onde o mundo vai parar? Quem se importa com você?. O que podemos alcançar? Quantos filhos devo ter?. Me diz o que eu preciso saber. Se vamos todos terminar num mesmo céu. Tantas batalhas pra ganhar nenhum troféu. Será que no fim das contas eu não soube dar valor?
1965,Drive,Rock,Outra vez o sol insiste em me cegar. Eu já nem sei como acordei nesse lugar. A noite parecia me levar. Pessoas tão vazias a me rodear. Mas a festa estava mesmo boa. Que eu quase não podia ouvir. A solidão que em mim ecoa. Um beijo pra me distrair. Cantando pra comemorar. De novo tudo que eu já vi. E o teu sorriso como antes. Me diz pra onde ir. E a música te faz dançar. De um jeito que faz sentir. Que o tempo para nesse instante. E eu volto a me trair. Quer saber? Não ligo pra o que vão falar. Se eu já ganhei a fama de não me importar. Eu digo tudo que você quer escutar. Mas quando acordo só quero que você se vá. Pra o mais distante da minha vida. Que você possa caminhar. Assim encontro uma saída. Pra falta que me faz amar. Cantando pra comemorar. De novo tudo que eu já vi. E o teu sorriso como antes. Me diz pra onde ir. E a música te faz dançar. De um jeito que faz sentir. Que o tempo para nesse instante. E eu volto a me trair. Eu vou olhar pra todos os lados. Vou encontrar inocentes culpados. Eu não preciso de motivos pra sair daqui. Melhor correr pra ver mais de perto. E esquecer o que não deu certo. Eu deixo a sorte me levar pra onde eu devo ir. Cantando pra comemorar. De novo tudo que eu já vi. E o teu sorriso como antes. Me diz pra onde ir. E a música te faz dançar. De um jeito que faz sentir. Que o tempo para nesse instante. E eu volto a me trair
1966,Drive,Rock,Quando bate a solidão. Nos obriga sempre a encarar. Coisas que se escondem no porão. Esmagando o nosso peito. Por que há uma sombra que me persegue. Em todo lugar que eu vou. Desfigurando e destruindo. Tudo o que eu fui e o que eu sou. Eu daria tudo agora. O meu sangue e a minha fé. Pra mandar essa sombra embora. Mas já não há como voltar atrás. Por que há uma sombra que me persegue. Em todo lugar que eu vou. Desfigurando e destruindo. Tudo o que eu fui e o que eu sou
1967,Drive,Rock,Pensa em mim como um amigo. Algo assim. Afinal meu atrevimento é natural. Deixa eu ser o escravo dessa maldição. Pra compreender que as meninas tem maior intuição. Olho pro céu e vou. Pintando o céu de azul. Esse é meu sonho azul. Eu quero ver o seu. paladar ansioso pra experimentar. Brisa vem me trazendo o frescor do mar. Deixa eu ser. O herói que vai te resgatar. Pra comprovar que as meninas tem melhor educação. Olho pro céu e vou. Pintando o céu de azul. Esse é meu sonho azul. Eu quero ver o seu. Olho pro céu e vou. Pintando o céu de azul. Esse é meu sonho azul. Eu quero ver o seu
1968,Drive,Rock,É tão dificil perceber. Que esse medo só te leva. Pra longe de mim. Eu quero e tem que ser assim ??. O que você chama de amor. Não pode me satisfazer é preciso. Ir até o fim. Tem coisas que não se pode fugir. Tem coisas que não se pode fugir. Você nasceu com esse dom. De me fazer voltar a ser um garoto outra vez. E tudo vai ser sempre assim. Nunca pensei em te dizer. Que o que falta em você. É saber o que falta em mim. Tem coisas que não se pode fugir (4x)
1969,Drive,Rock,Tão difícil de explicar. Eu já pensei em desistir. Não consegue demonstrar. Então não posso prosseguir. Sei que uma escolha errada pode nos levar. Por uma outra estrada pra um outro lugar. E assim eu vou tentando melhorar. Vou me perdendo aos poucos sem notar. Que eu já não tenho mais pra onde ir. Que o meu destino é te fazer sorrir. E eu só preciso te falar. Vou embora antes do fim. (Talvez por medo). E assim desisto de tentar. (Um outro jeito). Melhor que tudo acabe assim. (E no silêncio). O tempo possa te apagar. Sei que uma escolha errada pode nos levar. Por uma outra estrada pra um outro lugar. E assim eu vou tentando melhorar. Vou me perdendo aos poucos sem notar. Que agora eu sei pra onde devo ir. Que o meu destino foi te ver partir. E eu sigo em frente agora. Sei que uma escolha errada pode nos levar. Por uma outra estrada pra um outro lugar. E assim eu vou tentando melhorar. Vou me perdendo aos poucos sem notar. Que agora eu sei pra onde devo ir. Que o meu destino foi te ver partir. Preciso te dizer.... Vai que eu quero te ver bem longe daqui.. Nossa história não existe mais.. E eu quero morrer que seja de rir. De tudo que passei até agora.
1970,Drive,Rock,Não peço desculpas. Por não poder te dar algo melhor. Meus olhos perseguem. Sinais que possam me levar. De volta pra você. Eu quero a chance de tentar trazer você pra mim. Eu já passei do tempo de brincar de ser feliz. De quê adiantaria de tudo eu ter. Se aqui do meu lado. Não esta você. Não tem sentido. E além das lembranças te encontrar. E a cada manhã te reconquistar. Tudo que eu sempre quis. Não peço desculpas. Por não poder te dar algo melhor. Meus olhos perseguem. Sinais que possam me levar. De volta pra você. Eu quero a chance de tentar trazer você pra mim. Eu já passei do tempo de brincar de ser feliz. De quê adiantaria de tudo eu ter. Se aqui do meu lado. Não esta você. Não tem sentido. E além das lembranças te encontrar. E a cada manha te reconquistar. Tudo que eu sempre quis
1971,Drive,Rock,Muita coisa foi dita. Em pouco tem sem se falar. Muita coisa foi feita. Você não entende porque fui embora. Eu quero coisas que não posso tocar. Desse lugar. Eu sei que fiz tudo errado. Agora volto pra me desculpar. Sozinho e embriagado. Com lágrimas que não vou derramar. Você não entende porque fui embora. Eu quero coisas que não posso tocar. E assim te encontro sozinha ao meu lado. Me pedindo pra ficar sem pensar

I'm tired of livin' in the dark. Can anyone see me down here. The feeling's gone. There's nothing left to lift me up. Back into the world I know. And now again I've found myself so far down. Away from the sun that shines into the darkest place. I'm so far down away from the sun. That shines to light the way for me to find my way back. into the arms. That care about the ones like me. I'm so far down away from the sun again. It's down to this. I've got to make this life make sense. And now I can't tell what I've done. And now again I've found myself so far down. Away from the sun that shines to light the way for me. And now again I've found myself so far down. Away from the sun that shines into the darkest place. I'm so far down away from the sun. That shines to light the way for me to find my way back. into the arms. That care about the ones like me. I'm so far down away from the sun again
1992,3 Doors Down,Rock,So far away from knowing where I'm going. And trying hard to find out who I am. They all say that I don't know what I'm doing. I say they don't hardly understand. Why can't they remember. What I'll never forget. How these dreams can come undone. When you're young. (Chorus). You give what you give 'cause they make you. Trapped inside a place that won't take you. They want you to be what they make you. It's already over and done. When you're young. Everything seems perfect. Everything's okay. It will all get better now. At least that's what they say. But I don't see it coming. You give what you give 'cause they make you. Trapped inside a place that won't take you. They want you to be what they make you. It's already over and done. When you're young. Days really just seem longer. They say it's better this way. I hope one day I am stronger than I feel. And I hope it feels different than today. You give what you give 'cause they make you. Trapped inside a place that won't take you. They want you to be what they make you. It's already over and done. It's already over and done. It's already over and done. When you're young. Why can't they remember. What I'll never forget. How these dreams can come undone. When you're young
1993,3 Doors Down,Rock,Ohh yeah. Ohh yeah. You said I got something to say. and then you got that look in your eye. There is something you got to know. and you said it as you started to cry. I've been down the wrong road tonight. and I swear I'll never go there again. I've seen this face once before. and I don't think I can do this again. There's something I can see. There's something different in the way you smile. Behind those eyes you lie. And there's nothing I can say. Cause I'm never gonna change your mind. Behind those eyes you hide. As you turned to walk away. I saw another look in your eye. And even though it hurts like it did. I couldn't let this be a goodbye. You say that you're sorry. And you say now that it hurts you the same. Is there something here to believe?. Or is it just another part of the game?. There's something I can see. There's something different in the way you smile. Behind those eyes you lie. And there's nothing I can say. Cause I'm never gonna change your mind. Behind those eyes you hide. . Ohh yeah. Ooooooo.

How can you tell me how I feel?. All along I told you. That I cannot feel the pain. Who are you to tell me. I'm not good enough?. All I've ever wanted was a place. inside of you. Why should I hear what you say any longer?. When you don't even know where I've been. I feel something in me getting stronger. And I won't get kicked around again. If you won't listen to me.

1997,3 Doors Down,Rock,I don't mind what you do to me. I don't mind what I cannot see. If you care you will stay with me. If you dare you will set me free. If you let me try I will let you see again. If I let you die you will let me sleep again. Would you sell your soul for a game you like to play?. If you let me go I will burn your heart away. Well ur here when you should be gone. And my heart well its turned to stone. If I'm dead by the time you find out. just why I'm gone. Just say goodbye. If you let me try I will let you see again.

1998,3 Doors Down,Rock,Please be careful what you say. You might give that little heart away. Just remember everything I give. You might have a little time to live. Just remember everything I’ve lost. Truly you’ll remember everything it cost. Would you pay attention please?. Or make the same mistakes as me. I’m getting tired of you never understanding a word that I’m trying to say. Because you won’t listen to me. I’m not going to wade out so far. That I can’t stand on my own. You know I like it with my feet in the water. So please don’t leave me here alone. Just be careful what you say. You might give that little soul away. Will you throw away these days?. Without ever knowing your name. I’m getting tired of you never understanding a word that I’m trying to say. Because you won’t listen to me. I’m not going to wade out so far. That I can’t stand on my own. You know I like it with my feet in the water. So please don’t leave me here alone. [x4]. I want it. I feel it. I want it. I feel it. I need it more. I wanna watch you wade out so far. That you can’t stand on your own. You’re like a child with your feet in the water. And I can’t leave you alone. I’m not going to wade out so far.

1999,3 Doors Down,Rock,There's so much I would say. If I could see you one last time. But now I can't cause you're not here. But you're always on my mind. When I look up and you're not there. When I lie awake at night. All these things I ask myself. I don't know why. When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again. When it's the last time and you weren't ready for it to end. When a light leaves you standing along there in the dark. They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard. I look ahead but can't move on. I look back but I can't stay. I keep trying to be strong. But this pain it won't go away. I hope this will heal in time. Cause I can't go on like this. Right now I would give my life. For one last kiss. When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again. When it's the last time and you weren't ready for it to end. When a light leaves you standing along there in the dark. They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard. You'll be there on my mind. Standing in the sunshine. When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again. When it's the last time and you weren't ready for it to end. When a light leaves you standing along there in the dark. They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard
2000,3 Doors Down,Rock,I got lost out there in this world. Looking for a brand new way to fall down. It's no surprise that things gotten worse. And I think God never let me drown. I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven - I just had to go home. While I was having the time of my life. I think my soul died a little every day. I always called to say I'm sorry. You said it's okay. But you should be through it all - you never walked away. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven - I just had to go home. Into the arms of my angel. Into the peace I left behind. All I had to do to save my own life. Was to look into your eyes. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I just had to go home. I just had to go home. I just had to go home. Crédito: Ronaldy JF Cunha
2001,3 Doors Down,Rock,"""Well how do you know where you're going. When you don't know where you've been?. You hide the shame that you're not showin'. And you won't let anyone in. A crowded street can be a quiet place. When you're walking alone. So now you think that you're the only one. Who doesn't have to try. And you won't have to fail. If you're afraid to fly. Then I guess you never will. You hide behind your walls. Cause maybe he never hurts. Forgetting that there's something more. Than just knowing better. Your mistakes do not define you now. They tell you who you're not. You've got to live this life you're given. Like it's the only one you've got. The memories have left you broken. And the scars have never healed. The emptiness in you is growing. With so little left to feel. You're scared to look back on the days before. You're too tired to move on. And now you think that you're the only one. Who doesn't have to try. And you won't have to fail. If you're afraid to fly. Then I guess you never will. You hide behind your walls. Cause maybe he never hurts. Forgetting that there's something more. Than just knowing better. Your mistakes do not define you now. They tell you who you're not. You've got to live this life you're given. Like it's the only one you've got. What would it take. To get you to say that """"I'll try""""?. And what would you say if this. Was the last day of your life?. You hide behind your walls. Cause maybe he never hurts. Forgetting that there's something more. Than just knowing better. Your mistakes do not define you now. They tell you who you're not. You've got to live this life you're given. Like it's the only one you've got. You hide behind your walls. Cause maybe he never hurts. Forgetting that there's so much more. Than just knowing better. Your mistakes do not define you now. They tell you who you're not. You've got to live this life you're given. Like it's the only one you've got"""
2002,3 Doors Down,Rock,Say goodbye to all my troubles. Say goodbye to this. I'm saying goodbye to all the desperation I've lived in. It doeest hurt to talk about it. It sometimes helps me through. Now there's nothing left to talk about. I'll tell you..... Now it's time to say goodbye. I've been living this lie for way to long. I can't handle this lie got to say goodbye. I've been living this lie for way to long. Blame it on this way of thinking. Blame it on someone. There's no answers only questions that have come undone. It doesn't help to think about it. It only makes me feel used. Now there's nothing left to think about. Nothing's true..... Now it's time to say goodbye. I've been living this lie for way to long. I can't handle this lie got to say goodbye. I've been living this lie for way to long. I wish that we could do this all again. I wish that I could stay but I can't. And now it's time to leave this all behind. Of all the things to say we said goodbye. Now it's time to say goodbye. And now it's time to say goodbye. Now it's time to say goodbye. I've been living this lie for way to long. I can't handle this life. I can't handle this life. I can't handle this life. I'm dead
2003,3 Doors Down,Rock,You say this will be alright. Just put my faith in you. Let you have another try. And show me all that you can do. But now here we go again. Back down a dead-end street. I'm hoping maybe this time though. The truth and the lies might meet. But I don't think they'll get along. If I didn't know that look. And your eyes so well. Then maybe I could play your game. And maybe the lies you tell. You say this is for my good. Well my good could use some help. You promised me my heaven. But I'm living in your hell. Maybe in another life. And maybe I can find you there. Or maybe we can make this right. Or maybe I just wouldn't care. I've taken this long enough. And I can't go on this way. So I guess it's over now. There's only one thing left to say. It's time to be moving on. If I didn't know that look. And your eyes so well. Then maybe I could play your game. And maybe the lies you tell. You say this is for my good. Well my good could use some help. You promised me my heaven. But I'm living in your hell. You only want someone to blame. But that's just who you are. Well I all I wanted to find was something you did for. I thought that I had found something to last forever. But all there was to find is you're no better. You're no better. You're no better. You're no better. If I didn't know that look. And your eyes so well. Then maybe I could play your game. And maybe the lies you tell. You say this is for my good. Well my good could use some help. You promised me my heaven. But you know this too well. You say this is for my good. Well my good could use some help. You promised me my heaven. But I'm living in your hell
2004,3 Doors Down,Rock,Cloud in my mind. Trouble my thoughts. Your silence is beauty. But your beauty is lost. There's a sandy man hidden. You seven times think. That you're very tired and ridden. But you never once blink. There's a man in my mind. Kickin' in the walls. Trailin' my innocence. Paralyzing all my thoughts. Got a wide eyed view. From a chemical thrill. Set in the pace of time. And prowlin' the killin' field. Tracer from far away. To this life in my empty cell. It seems life is just a lie. But there's still the lie to tell. There's a man in my mind. Kickin' in the walls. Trailin' my innocence. Paralyzing all my thoughts. There's a man in my mind. Kickin' in the walls. Trailin' my innocence. Paralyzing all my thoughts. There's man in my mind. There's a man. The man in mine
2005,3 Doors Down,Rock,Your stuck on a chain. And your toeing a lie. Seems like everytime that you catch up. You only fall behind. And your trapped inside this world you made yourself. But that's not the world I live in. This is not the life for me. Cause my world is bigger than your problems. And it's bigger than me. That's not the world I live in. This is not the life for me. Cause my world is bigger than your problems. And it's bigger than me. There is always someone to blame. For the things you do yourself. You think that everything that's going wrong. Is because of someone else. And your trapped inside this world you made yourself. That's not the world I live in. This is not the life for me. Cause my world is bigger than your problems. And it's bigger than me. It's not the world I live in. This is not the life for me. Cause my world is bigger than your problems. And it's bigger than me [2x]. Cause I'm lonely outside and i'll look on in. And that's not the world I live in. This is not the life for me. Cause my world is bigger than your problems. And it's bigger than me. It's not the world I live in. This is not the life for me. Cause my world is bigger than your problems. And it's bigger than me. Cause my world is bigger than your problems. And it's bigger than me...
2006,3 Doors Down,Rock,Lay me down. Wash this blood off of my hands for me. while I cry out. Don't let me die before I go to sleep. I can't keep going but I cannot start again. Refrão:. The road I walk is paved with the broken. promises I made. At least a million times I've fallen. but never will I break. These walls I make they hold me in and hold me back today. but tomorrow's new. Then I walk right out and walk right over you. If you hear me screaming please don't let me fall again. Refrão. My time is on its way. I'll fall but I won't break. Refrão
2007,3 Doors Down,Rock,Why do you make me feel so ugly inside and out. What is it I say what is in your brain. That makes you so damn sure that. What you want is what I'm trying to be. Nothing's real but what's inside. If I'm so blind then how can I see. I can feel you pulling me under. I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down. I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down. Why should I try when nothing I do makes you proud. All the words you say they don't mean a thing. The silence screams so loud. What you want is what I'm trying to be. Nothing's real but what's inside. If I'm so blind than how can I see. I can feel you pulling me under. I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down. I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down. I'm down. I'm down. I'm down. I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down. I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down. I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down. I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down. I'm down. I'm down
2008,3 Doors Down,Rock,The open wound she hides. She just keeps it bundled up. And never lets it show. She can't take much more of this. But she can't let it go. And that's ok... She don't want the world. And all the things she says. He's just lying there. Without someone to hear her cry. She slips off into a dream. About a place to hide. And that's ok... She don't want the world. This love she feels. Everything she's havent known. Or ever thought was real. Seems like it's been thrown away. Now how she gonna live. It's ok... She don't want the world. Those words she never spoke. Hold a life of memories of all the times before. She tried to show him love. While he would only ask for more. But its ok... She don't want the world. Softly in her sleep. Pictures of the life she's longing for slowly appear. She has seen them all before. But somehow never quite this clear. She just smiles... She don't want the world. This love she feels. Everything she's havent known. Or ever thought was real. Seems like it's been thrown away. Now how she gonna live. It's ok... She don't want the world. A brand new morning shines. She wakes up alone again. This time to face the day. She swears this time to make it. As she simply walks away. And it's ok... She don't want the world
2009,3 Doors Down,Rock,She walks through the city. No one recognizes her face. They don't want her pity. No one ever mentions her name. She's carried the broken. But their scars have no name in her heart. 'Cause she walks in forgiveness. She'll shine like a light in the dark. She is love. She is love. She is love. She is love. She'll always remember. The days when they welcomed her here. They know if they need her. She made a promise to always be here. She is love. She is love. She is love. She is love. When they are weak she will always be strong. Though they don't know it they're never alone. No matter how many times they may leave. It's never hopeless 'cause she still believes. She is love. She is love. She is love. She is love. She is love. She is love. Crédito: mandinhacolares
2010,3 Doors Down,Rock,This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her. When she smiles.. How many days in a year. She woke up with hope but she only found tears?. I can be so insincere. Making the promises never for real. As long as she stands there waiting. Wearing the holes in the souls of her shoes. How many days disappear?. You look in the mirror so how do you choose?. And the clothes that you wear. Look swell the next day. Your hair never falls in quite the same way. You never seem to run out of things to say.. This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her. When she smiles.. How many lovers would stay?. Just to put up with this shit day after day. How did we wind up this way?. Watching our mouths for the words that we say. As long as we stand here waiting. Wearing the clothes on the souls of our shoes. How do we get there today?. When we're walking too far for the price of her shoes.. And the clothes that you wear. Look swell the next day. Your hair never falls in quite the same way. You never seem to run out of things to say.. This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her. When she smiles.. And the clothes that you wear. Look swell the next day. Your hair never falls in quite the same way. You never seem to run out of things to say.. This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her.. This is the story of a girl. Her pretty face she hid from the world. And while she looks so sad and lonely there. I absolutely love her.. This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her. When she smiles!. When she smiles!
2011,3 Doors Down,Rock,I'm about to be on the floor again. Surely you're gonna find me here. I'm about to sleep until the end of time. Drug I take won't wake my fear right now. I'm passing away onto the better life. I'm passing away onto the better!. I'm about to see just how far I can fly. Surely you're gonna break my fall. I'm about to run as fast as I can.

2012,3 Doors Down,Rock,I wanted to find somewhere to hide. And i opened up and left those fears inside. And i wanted to be in near on this. Only to find that there was noone there but me. But i woke up to real life. And i realised its not worth running from anymore. When there was nowhere left to hide i found out. That nothings real here but i wont stop now until i find a. Better part of me. I let those hard days get me down. And all the things i hate got in my way. I could of screamed without a sound. I found myself silenced by those things they say. But i woke up to real life. And i realised its not worth running from anymore. When there was nowhere left to hide i found out. That nothings real here but i wont stop now until i find a. Better part of me. Thats out there somewhere. And it cant be that far away. Thats where ill find myself. And ill find my way out. Thats where ill find out. But i woke up to real life. And i realised its not worth running from anymore. When there was nowhere left to hide i found out. That nothings real here but i wont stop now until i find a. Better part of me
2013,3 Doors Down,Rock,This world asks for so much. Despite what you give it's just never enough. Then you're left cold tired and alone. Searching for something that's already gone. You try not to be afraid. Bound down by all of these things that they say. And you feel like you're all by yourself. But I'll be right here when there's nothing else. Lay down. Rest here in peace in my arms now. Knowing you're safe. From the storms and the rain. And from all of your pain. And I'll be here when only the silence remains. Only the silence remains. Your fears they know that you're scared. Wherever you go they seem to meet you there. And you face them all on your own. Never the weak always the strong. And you win most of the time. Never once claiming that victory's mine. And you carry this burden alone. But this candle's burned at both ends for so long. Lay down. Rest here in peace in my arms now. Knowing you're safe. From the storms and the rain. And from all of your pain. And I'll be here when only the silence remains. Lay down. Lay down. Lay down. Rest here in peace in my arms now. Knowing you're safe. From the storms and the rain. And from all of your pain. And I'll be here when only the silence remains. Rest here in peace in my arms now. Knowing you're safe. From the storms and the rain. And from all of your pain. And I'll be here when only the silence remains

Tell me who will save you. When there's no one else around. And you can't turn to me?. Tell me where will you be?. When it's over. And all this pride you hold inside is gone. Tell me where will you hide?. When it's over. Everything you know is said and done. When it's over where will you run?. Do your memories haunt your dreams?. Do they simply seem to have a mind of their own?. Tell me what the emptiness brings. Everything you know is everything but gone. Tell me who will save you. When there's no one else around. And you can't turn to me?. Tell me where will you be?. When it's over. And all this pride you hold inside is gone. Tell me where will you hide?. When it's over. Everything you know is said and done. When it's over where will you run?. You can't hold your world together now. Everyone sees who you really are. When your castle crumbles at your feet. Don't you run to me. When it's over.... And all this pride you hold inside is dying.... Where will you hide?!. When it's over. And all this pride you hold inside is gone. Tell me where will you hide?. When it's over. Everything you know is said and done. When it's over where will you run?
2016,3 Doors Down,Rock,So far away from knowing where I'm going. And trying hard to find out who I am. They all say that I don't know what I'm doing. I say they don't hardly understand. Why can't they remember. What I'll never forget. How these dreams can come undone. When you're young. (Chorus). You give what you give 'cause they make you. Trapped inside a place that won't take you. They want you to be what they make you. It's already over and done. When you're young. Everything seems perfect. Everything's okay. It will all get better now. At least that's what they say. But I don't see it coming. You give what you give 'cause they make you. Trapped inside a place that won't take you. They want you to be what they make you. It's already over and done. When you're young. Days really just seem longer. They say it's better this way. I hope one day I am stronger than I feel. And I hope it feels different than today. You give what you give 'cause they make you. Trapped inside a place that won't take you. They want you to be what they make you. It's already over and done. It's already over and done. It's already over and done. When you're young. Why can't they remember. What I'll never forget. How these dreams can come undone. When you're young
2017,3 Doors Down,Rock,You're not what I need anymore. Forget those games you're playin'. You're not what I need anymore. I can't hear what you're saying. If you won't listen to me. How can you tell me how I feel?. All along I told you. That I cannot feel the pain. Who are you to tell me. I'm not good enough?. All I've ever wanted was a place. inside of you. Why should I hear what you say any longer?. When you don't even know where I've been. I feel something in me getting stronger. And I won't get kicked around again. If you won't listen to me. How can you tell me how I feel?. All along I told you. That I cannot feel the pain. Who are you to tell me. I'm not good enough?. All I've ever wanted was a place. inside of you. If you won't listen to me. How can you tell me how I feel?. All along I told you. That I cannot feel the pain. Who are you to tell me. I'm not good enough?. All I've ever wanted was a place. inside of you. You're not what I need anymore!
2018,3 Doors Down,Rock,I think I walked to close to love and now I'm falling in. I felt so many things this weary soul can't take. Maybe you just caught me by surprise. The first time I looked into your eyes.... There's a life inside of me that I can feel again. It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been. I don't care if I lost everything that I have known. It don't matter where I lay my head tonight. Your arms feel like home...feel like home.... This life ain't the fairy tale we both thought it would be. I can see your smiling face as its staring back at me. I know we both see these changes now.... I know we both understand somehow.... There's a life inside of me that I can feel again. It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been. I don't care if I lost everything that I have known. It don't matter where I lay my head tonight. Your arms feel like home...they feel like home to me.... (Just hold onto me). There's a life inside of me that I can feel again. It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been. I don't care if I lost everything that I have known. It don't matter where I lay my head tonight. Your arms feel like home... feel like home...they feel like home

2022,A Day To Remember,Rock,Been through a lot this last year. Like everything I love is slipping away. And every time I come home. Somebody it isn't there. I got to get it together. I got to do things for myself. I've giving everything. Plus you take some from me. I need some room to breath. Come on come on. You know this isn't what we planned on. Come on come on. Tell me will be ok. (will be ok). Let's go back let's go back. To a time where I. Still felt I had a family. This isn't what I remember. Everyone is looking. Out for just themselves. If need be I'll be happy to leave. I see straight through. That smile straight through. That painted face. Don't think I can't tell. Which one of you is against me. Come on come on. You know this isn't what we planned on. Come on come on. Tell me will be ok. (will be ok). Lets go back lets go back. To a time where I. Still felt I had a family. I am the greatest thing that falls. I turn my back and out came the wolves. Pay attention!!!!. Come on come on. You know this isn't what we planned on. Come on come on. Tell me will be ok. (will be ok). Lets go back lets go back. To a time where I. Still felt I had a family. Been through a lot this last year. Like everything I love is slipping away
2023,A Day To Remember,Rock,Tonight I'm sending you a message. This is the end of an era. The end of second chances. In the face of defeat. I'm winning. Yet you still have so much left to say. Oh they're coming straight for me. Oh they're coming straight for me. Read between the lines. We can't give in this time. Just let me go for now i'll be just fine. Don't ya know don't ya know. Now that I'm back on my own. Tell me how it feels. To watch the walls of your security crumble. I remember you. You took the easy way out. When I gave you something to stand for. I was just another promise you couldn't keep
2024,A Day To Remember,Rock,(I trusted you..). Wake up. I've been... watching you..
2025,A Day To Remember,Rock,What I hate about getting older. Where's my naivety?. Wonder when I'm gonna get taller. Where's my naivety?. Thinkin back when we were younger. All of the things we believed that we could do. Don't wanna live by fear of failure. Where's my naivety?. Somehow lost along the way. This is me. Honestly. I've got no apologies. I'm done chasing things that don't belong to me. This is real. It's how I feel. With one shoulder on the wheel. What I'm searchin for grows further out of reach. What I hate about getting older. Where's my naivety?. Wonder what it's like not bein sober. Where's my naivety?. Lookin back when we were younger. Every mistake was a chance that we could take. Now I think I'm just gettin colder. Where's my naivety?. It got lost along the way. This is me. Honestly. I've got no apologies. I'm done chasing things that don't belong to me. This is real. It's how I feel. With one shoulder on the wheel. What I'm searchin for grows further out of reach. I swear you won't take me back. I don't care that's all in my past. I'm waitin for what's next. And I won't let it slip away. Get me through another day. This is me. Honestly. I've got no apologies. I'm done chasing things that don't belong to me. This is real. It's how I feel. With one shoulder on the wheel. What I'm searchin for grows further out of reach
2026,A Day To Remember,Rock,I never knew. I never knew that everything was falling through. That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue. To turn and run when all I needed was the truth. But that's how it's got to be. It's coming down to nothing more than apathy. I'd rather run the other way than stay and see. The smoke and who's still standing when it clears. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head. Over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind. She's on your mind. Let's rearrange. I wish you were a stranger I could disengage. Just say that we agree and then never change. Soften a bit until we all just get along. But that's disregard. Find another friend and you discard. As you lose the argument in a cable car. Hanging above as the canyon comes between. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head. Over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind. She's on your mind. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head. Over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind. She's on your mind. And suddenly I become a part of your past. I'm becoming the part that don't last. I'm losing you and its effortless. Without a sound we lose sight of the ground. In the throw around. Never thought that you wanted to bring it down. I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head. Over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind. She's on your mind. Everyone knows. She's on your mind. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head. Everyone Over my. Everyone Over my. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head. Over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind. She's on your mind
2027,A Day To Remember,Rock,just hold your breath. to make sure you wont wake up again. cause you ruined my 04. that's the best that i could hope for. to watch you fall apart from the inside. we're gonna spread it to the world. to the world. about how you lied. how you lied. a free lesson on growing up. never trust anyone to the point. where your backs exposed. every person i've ever known was a fake. and you'll see your closest ones go first. who needs enemies you've got friends. i'm a gentleman and you're a liar. i expect the best of you but it's so hard. but it's so hard. lets start over. when we reach the top well watch you bury yourself. this wasn't easy. it wasn't easy. a free lesson on growing up. make the best of their worst. and never compromise what you feel is right. i make a point to be powerful when i speak. be the one that gives them nightmares when they sleep. never back down from anyone. i watched the weight of your world. cave in to crush you
2028,A Day To Remember,Rock,This is my vengeance for all the wrongs. You've formed against us. You always get me wrong. My whole existence revolves around the progress that we've made. I'll never be walked on again. I'm on the edge of the rooftop. Thinking nobody will ever know. I hope that you'd want to be the one to see. The distance from the road. This is our triumph over all the forms of filth. you've spread. Well never let this go. Right from the very start I knew this day would come. Tonights the night we silence you. There's nowhere left to run. Let this be your reminder. I'm everything that you wanted to be. Hope for the best but it's over. And you thought you were better than me. Such a pretty picture. Your chalk line on the ground. I hope you die
2029,A Day To Remember,Rock,I've learned to let go. Come on. Here's a middle finger. Coming straight from oca-l-a. I appreciate your judgement. it's proved that I can't trust a word you say. those must be some pair of binoculars. that you see every move I make. so I'll never be a liar. but you'll always be two-faced. You'll get what's coming to you. You're blinded by your instincts. I'm not your fucking game. I'm not so easily beat. I'm looking down at this mess that you've made. and I can't believe that I stayed. So unhappy for so long. Where did I go wrong?. I've got to get out of this. my hand is on the handle. We're leaving everything behind. Goodbye for a lifetime. I'll rip that scandalous bitch in two. We'll bring the noise. Try to pretend that I never even knew your name. 'cause everything you are disgusts me. (Too bad I can't turn back time). So I wouldn't be here. what I'd give for you to disappear. so tell me girly how's your edge?. You've got nothing better to do. I know why you can't see straight. I thought you were better than this. but you're just like everyone else. I'm looking down at this mess that you've made. and I can't believe that I stayed. So unhappy for so long. Where did I go wrong?. I've got to get out of this. my hand is on the handle. We're leaving everything behind. Goodbye for a lifetime. I'll make my stand. right here with my friends. I'll make my stand. right here with my friends. I'll make my stand. right here with my friends. I'll make my stand. right here with my friends. I'll make my stand. right here with my friends. Get low. Now I know who my friends are. I'm never coming home
2030,A Day To Remember,Rock,Days rolled on. Shout it out loud. Days rolled on. We know the price we pay. Days rolled on. Shout it out loud. Days rolled on. We know the price we pay. Days rolled on. Shout it out loud. Days rolled on. We know the price we pay. Days rolled on. Shout it out loud. Days rolled on. We know the price we pay. Days rolled on. Shout it out loud. Days rolled on. We know the price we pay
2031,A Day To Remember,Rock,This sun has set on your heart. Chances for redemption. And I have forgotten your name. And I thought it'd be easy. To move on completely. Forgetting what was real and what was. Forget the past. Don't for once think you're better than what I have. You're the reason I never trusted anyone. Forget the past. Don't for once think you're better than what I have. You're the reason I never trusted anyone. Just to forget. Wouldn't make me as happy as. It would to hate. Just to forgive is so much more. Than you are worth. Think the time I spent. Well so do I. And you. Tore. My life apart. Single breath. You could've cared less if I was dead. If I was dead. Just to forget. Wouldn't make me as happy as. It would to hate. Just to forgive is so much more. Than you are worth. Worth. You care so much. About yourself. That it makes me sick to think of you. Do you think how much I lost. For you?
2032,A Day To Remember,Rock,It's the start of a brand new day. And I'm struggling to stay awake. So I can just stumble outside. Losing hope and my whole life. I'm just scraping by. Hoping no one will notice me. Here I am again. Trying to give in. To another bitter end. I don't think it'd be wrong. To be alone tonight. Please make this all end. (And I'm watching the lights flow by). Watching the cars pass. Thinking they won't last. Darkness clouds all of my windows. Darkness clouds all of my windows. Taking my last breath. Time flows out my chest. I have lost the will to be. I have lost the will to be. Here I am again. Trying to give in. To another bitter end. I don't think it'd be wrong. To be alone tonight. Please make this end. And I could of changed the world. with my accomplishments. And I could of changed the world. with my accomplishments. Here I am again. Trying to give in. To another bitter end. I don't think it'd be wrong. To be alone tonight. Please make this end. And I could of changed the world. With my accomplishments. And I could of changed the world. With my accomplishments. And I could of changed the world. With my accomplishments. And I could of changed the world. With my accomplishments

2045,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I had no choice but to hear you. You stated your case time and again. I thought about it. You treat me like I'm a princess. I'm not used to liking that. You ask how my day was. (chorus). You've already won me over in spite of me. Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet. Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are. I couldn't help it. It's all your fault. Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole. You're so much braver than I gave you credit for. That's not lip service. (repeat chorus). You are the bearer of unconditional things. You held your breath and the door for me. Thanks for your patience. You're the best listener that I've ever met. You're my best friend. Best friend with benefits. What took me so long. And I've never felt this healthy before. And I've never wanted something rational. And I am aware now. And I am aware now. (repeat chorus)
2046,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone. I recommend walking around naked in your living room. Swallow it down (what a jagged little pill). It feels so good (swimming in your stomach). Wait until the dust settles. (chorus). You live you learn. You love you learn. You cry you learn. You lose you learn. You bleed you learn. You scream you learn. I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone. I certainly do. I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time. Feel free. Throw it down (the caution blocks you from the wind). Hold it up (to the rays). You wait and see when the smoke clears. (repeat chorus). Wear it out (the way a three-year-old would do). Melt it down (you're gonna have to eventually anyway). The fire trucks are coming up around the bend. (repeat chorus). You grieve you learn. You choke you learn. You laugh you learn. You choose you learn. You pray you learn. You ask you learn. You live you learn

Even if I gained 10 pounds. That I would be fine. Even if I went bankrupt. That I would be good. If I lost my hair and my youth. That I would be great. If I was no longer queen. That I would be grand. If I was not all knowing. That I would be loved. Even when I numb myself. That I would be good. Even when I am overwhelmed. That I would be loved. Even when I was fuming. That I would be good. Even if I was clinging. That I would be good. Even if I lost sanity. That I would be good. Whether with or without you
2048,Alanis Morissette,Rock,How about getting off of these antibiotics. How about stopping eating when I'm full up. How about them transparent dangling carrots. How about that ever elusive kudo. Thank you India. Thank you terror. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you frailty. Thank you consequence. Thank you thank you silence. How about me not blaming you for everything. How about me enjoying the moment for once. How about how good it feels to finally forgive you. How about grieving it all one at a time. Thank you India. Thank you terror. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you frailty. Thank you consequence. Thank you thank you silence. The moment I let go of it was. The moment I got more than I could handle. The moment I jumped off of it was. The moment I touched down. How about no longer being masochistic. How about remembering your divinity. How about unabashedly bawling your eyes out. How about not equating death with stopping. Thank you India. Thank you providence. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you nothingness. Thank you clarity.

2049,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Like anyone would be. I am flattered by your fascination with me. Like any hot blooded woman. I have simply wanted an object to crave. But you you're not allowed. You're uninvited. An unfortunate slight. Must be strangely exciting. To watch the stoic squirm. Must be somewhat heartening. To watch them burn me shepherd. But you you're not allowed. You're uninvited. An unfortunate slight. Like any uncharted territory. I must seem greatly intriguing. You speak of my love like. You have experienced love like mine before. But this is not allowed. You're uninvited. An unfortunate slight. I don't think you unworthy. I need a moment to deliberate
2050,Alanis Morissette,Rock,There's a little black spot on the sun today. It's the same old thing as yesterday. There's a black hat caught in a high tree top. There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I'm always hoping. that you'll end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the king of pain. There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall. (that's my soul up there). There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall. (that's my soul up there). There's a blue whale beached. by a springtide's ebb. That's my soul up there). There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I'm always hoping. that you'll end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the king of pain. There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out. There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt. There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed. There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread. There's a red fox tornb by a huntsman's pack. There's a black winged gull with a broken back. There's a little black spot on the sun today. It's the same old thing as yesterday. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I always hoping. that you will end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the queen of pain. I'll always be queen of pain
2051,Alanis Morissette,Rock,My mind is invaded. My gates are ignored. My thoughts are negated. And you're on a roll. And I am offended. By your acts of shamelessness. Your lack of conscience. And your flagrant steamroll. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. My sorrow is lift off.

What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?

2053,Alanis Morissette,Rock,How crass you stand before me with. no blood to fuel your fame. How dare you wield such flippancy. without requisite shame. Your very existence becomes. my scared mission's bane. You bow to kiss my hand. and I ignore ignited flame. I moved to meet you. Untouched I do remain. To some it seems foreign my eye. Would steely forge ahead. This land entrusted to me knows. not of hallowed secrets. I'll keep it to myself. my irade eye swim in my head. Your charm can not distract me from. the path I'm born to tread. How I'm thrilled to know you. Unaffected I remained. How I've learned to like you. Undeterred I do remain. Less daunting as team.

Then my life can finally begin. I'll be worthy right?. Only when you realize the gem I am?. But this won't work now the way it once did. And I won't keep it up even though I would love to. Once I know who I'm not then I'll know who I am. But I know I won't keep on playing the victim. These precious illusions in my head. Did not let me down when I was defenseless. And parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends. This ring will help me yet. As will you knight in shining armor. This pill will help me yet. As will these boys gone through like water. But this won't work as well as the way it once did. Cuz I want to decide between survival and bliss. And though I know who I'm not I still don't know who I am. But I know I won't keep on playing the victim. These precious illusions in my head. Did not let me down when I was a kid. And parting with them is like parting with a childhood best friend. I've spent so long firmly looking outside me. I've spent so much time living in survival mode. This won't work now the way it once did. Cause I want to decide between survival and bliss. Now I know who I'm not I don't I still don't know who I am. But I know I won't keep on playing the victim. These precious illusions in my head. Did not let me down when I was defenseless. And parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends. These precious illusions in my head. Did not let me down when I was a kid. And parting with them is like parting with childhood best friends

2062,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I can be a nightmare of the grandest kind. I can withhold like it's going out of style. I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen. and you've never met anyone who’s as positive. As I am sometimes. You see everything you see every part. You see all my light and you love my dark. You dig everything of which I'm ashamed. There's not anything to which you can’t relate. And you're still here. I blame everyone else not my own partaking. My passive-aggressiveness can be devastating. I'm the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known. And you've never met anyone_as…as everything as I am. sometimes. You see everything you see every part. You see all my light and you love my dark. You dig everything of which I'm ashamed. There's not anything to which you can’t relate. and you still here.

2063,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Why no one will help me. I am too dumb I am too smart. They'll not understand me. I am lonely. They'll hate me. And there is not enough time. It's too hard to help me. And God wants me to work. No resting no lazy. These excuses how they served me so well. They've kept me safe. They've kept me stuck. They've kept me locked in my own cell. I'm too far from home. It takes far too much energy. And I cannot afford to. No one will ever see me. These excuses how they served me so well. They've kept me safe. They've kept me stuck. They've kept me locked in my own cell. These excuses how they're so familiar. They've kept me blocked. They've kept me small. They've kept me safe inside my shell. Bringing this into the light. Shakes their foundation. And it clears my side. Now my imagination. Is the only thing that limits. The bar that is raised to the heights. No one can have it all see. I have to they want me to. And I can't let them down. I'll never be happy. These excuses how they served me so well. They've kept me safe. They've kept me stuck. They've kept me locked in my own cell. These excuses how they're so familiar. They've kept me blocked. They've kept me small. They've kept me safe inside my shell
2064,Alanis Morissette,Rock,My misery has enjoyed company. and although I have ached. I don't threaten anybody. sometimes I feel more bigness than I've shared with you. sometimes I wonder why I quell when I'm not required to. I've tried to be small I've tried to be stunted. I've tried roadblocks and all. my happy endings prevented. sometimes I feel it's all just too big to be true. I sabotage myself for fear of what my bigness could do. fear of bliss and fear of joyitude. fear of bigness (and ensuing solitude?). I could be golden I could be glowing I could be freedom. but that could be boring. sometimes I feel this is too scary to be true. I sabotage myself for fear of losing you. this talk of liberation makes me want to go lie down. under the covers til the terror of the unknown is gone. I could be full I could be thriving I could be shining. sounds isolating. sometimes I feel this is too good to be true. I sabotage myself for fear of what my joy could do.
2065,Alanis Morissette,Rock,"""Baby I've got this thing for you. I'm thinkin' there's something goin' on now. A wicked imagination. A serious kind of something new. It's drivin' me right out of my mind now. It's gotta be desperation. Can't feel no pain when I'm thinkin' about you. Dreamin' isn't black and white. Can't make no gain 'til my vision c-comes true. Give it to me like I'd like to give it to you. Chorus:. Love I wanna feel your love. Right from the bottom of your heart to your hands. (now baby now) Love I wanna feel your love.

2066,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I am driving in my car up highway one. I left LA without telling anyone. There were people who needed something from me. But I am sure they’ll get along fine on their own. Oh this state of ecstasy. Nothing but road could ever give to me. This liberty wind in my face. And I’m giggling again for no reason. I am dancing with my friends in elation. We’ve taken adventures to new levels of fun. I can feel the bones are smiling in my body. I can see the meltings of inhibition. Oh this state of ecstasy. Nothing but road could ever give to me. This liberty wind in my face. And I’m giggling again for no reason. I’m reeling jubilation. Triumphant in delight. I am at home in this high five. And I’m smiling for no reason. I am sitting at the set of cali sun. We’ve gotten quiet for its’ last precious seconds. I can feel the salt of the sea on my skin. And we still hear the echoes of abandon. Oh this state of ecstasy

2068,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Just when I thought. I had handles on this. I could soften my guard behind false confidence. Just when I found. Humble pie insipid. Exempt from this blindside and firmly in its grip. Cause I'm seduced by reaction and under the influence. I'm sliping again I'm. Up to my tricks off my wagon. I have no defense I'm. Wreaking havoc. Wreaking havoc and consequence. I get reduced by my own willfulness as. I reach for my usual God replacements. Cause I am rich with sanction and lax in my steps. I'm sliping again I'm. Up to my tricks off my wagon. I have no defense I'm. Wreaking havoc. Wreaking havoc and consequence. It forgiveness is understanding then I. offer mea culpa for the millionth time. From this toppling house of card of mine. I am beaten by my impulsiveness. By this uncanny foreshadowing of regret. Cause I'm repulsed by restriction at least that's my excuse. I'm sliping again I'm. Up to my tricks off my wagon. I have no defense I'm. Wreaking havoc. Wreaking havoc and consequence
2069,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I had no choice but to hear you. You stated your case time and again. I thought about it. You treat me like I'm a princess. I'm not used to liking that. You ask how my day was. (chorus). You've already won me over in spite of me. Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet. Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are. I couldn't help it. It's all your fault. Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole. You're so much braver than I gave you credit for. That's not lip service. (repeat chorus). You are the bearer of unconditional things. You held your breath and the door for me. Thanks for your patience. You're the best listener that I've ever met. You're my best friend.

I remember vividly a day years ago we were camping you knew more than you thought you should know. you said """"I don't want ever to be brainwashed"""" and you were mindboggling you were intense. you were uncomfortable in your own skin you were thirsty but mostly you were beautiful. if we were our nametags. if we were our rejections. if we were our outcomes i'd be joining you. if we were our indignities. if we were our successes. if we were our emotions i'd be joining you. you and i we're like four year olds we want to know why and how come about everything. we want to reveal ourselves at will and speak out minds and never talk small and be intuitive. and question mightily and find god my tortured beacon. we need to find like-minded companions. if we were their condemnations. if we were their projections. if we were our paranoias i'd be joining you. if we were our incomes. if we were our obsessions. if we were our afflictions i'd be joining you. we need reflection we need a really good memory feel free to call me a little more often"""
2073,Alanis Morissette,Rock,There's a little black spot on the sun today. It's the same old thing as yesterday. There's a black hat caught in a high tree top. There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I'm always hoping. that you'll end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the king of pain. There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall. (that's my soul up there). There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall. (that's my soul up there). There's a blue whale beached. by a springtide's ebb. That's my soul up there). There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I'm always hoping. that you'll end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the king of pain. There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out. There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt. There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed. There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread. There's a red fox tornb by a huntsman's pack. There's a black winged gull with a broken back. There's a little black spot on the sun today. It's the same old thing as yesterday. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I always hoping. that you will end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the queen of pain. I'll always be queen of pain
2074,Alanis Morissette,Rock,We have slaughtered. If the garden of beauty. Digging graves instead of planting. Mercy for the crucified. A bitter justice. Begging eternity for love. We´re nothing. We´re everything. I am nothing. Yet I am everybody. We´re nothing. And yet we are. Wisdom lights up life´s road. I know you
2075,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I've never been this accountable-less and within. I've never known focuslessness on any form. I've never had this lack of ache for dalliance. To let go and let god in ways I have never even imagined. I declare a moratorium on things relationship. I declare a respite from the toils of liaison. I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement. I declare a full time out from all this commitment. I've never let my grasp soften fingers like this. I've never been careless otherless like autonomy's twin. I declare a moratorium on things relationship. I declare a respite from the toils of liaison. I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement. I declare a full time out from all this commitment. Ah to breathe. Stop looking outside. Stop searching in corners of rooms. Not my business or timing. Ahhh. I've never known freedom from intertwining. I start again this time for keeps in my skin I'm residing. I declare a moratorium on things relationship. I declare a respite from the toils of liaison. I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement. I declare a full time out from all this commitment. by /snipes_
2076,Alanis Morissette,Rock,We have slaughtered. In the garden of beauty. Digging graves instead of planting. Mercy for the crucified. A bitter justice. Begging eternity for love. We're nothing. We're everything. I am nothing. Yet I am everybody. We're nothing. And yet we are. Wisdom lights up life's road. I know you.
2077,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Before my body dies. I pray. That the river I was born to. May again wash over me. By God's touch I pray. That I may move from this consecrated. Earth. Into the next season. A dark season. Beyond the dying religions that. Seduced us. My soul will surrender. And give in to grace. .
2078,Alanis Morissette,Rock,My unborn forgive me. I only wish I had the strength to bring. You into this world. More faithful. . . . . . . .
2079,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Dear momma's boy I know you've had your butt licked by your mother. I know you've enjoyed all that attention from her. And every woman graced with your presence after. Dear narcissus boy I know you've never really apologized for anything. I know you've never really taken responsibility. I know you've never really listened to a woman. Dear me-show boy I know you're not really into conflict resolution. Or seeing both sides of every equation. Or having an uninterrupted conversation. And any talk of healthiness. And any talk of connectedness. And any talk of resolving this. Leaves you running for the door. (why why do I try to love you. Try to love you when you really don't want me. To). Dear egotist boy you've never really had to suffer any consequence. You've never stayed with anyone longer than ten minutes. You'd never understand anyone showing resistance. Dear popular boy I know you're used to getting everything so easily. A stranger to the concept of reciprocity. People honor boys like you in this society. And any talk of selflessness. And any talk of working at this. And any talk of being of service. Leaves you running for the door. (why why do I try to help you try to help you. When you really don't want me to). You go back to the women who will dance the dance. You go back to your friends who will lick your ass. You go back to ignoring all the rest of us. You go back to the center of your universe. Dear self centered boy I don't know why I still feel affected by you. I've never lasted very long with someone like you. I never did although I have to admit I wanted to. Dear magnetic boy you've never been with anyone who doesn't take your shit. You've never been with anyone who's dared to call you on it. I wonder how you'd be if someone were to call you on it. And any talk of willingness. And any talk of both feet in. And any talk of commitment. Leaves you running for the door. (why why do I try to change you try to. Try to change you when you really don't. Want me to). You go back to the women who will dance the dance. You go back to your friends who will lick your ass. You go back to being so oblivious. You go back to the center of the universe.
2080,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I've had glimpses of the highest versions since my youth. I saw pictures of these predetermineds. That were extraordinary. They were born out the gate. What to do when they come true. Well you naysayers. And you dream killers. And by all others be damned. I'm an example of perseverance. In the face of 'you can't'. I'd seen moments of sweet partnership before we could. I've had times where I could smell. The smells of something pure portending. I saw sea colored eyes. What to do when they come true. Well you naysayers. And you dream killers. And by all others be damned. I'm an example of perseverance. In the face of 'you can't'. I've had goals of serving far and wide while ridiculed. I've had notions of a family with someone brave like you. They were feared? and inviting. What to do when they come true. Well you naysayers. And you dream killers. And by all others be damned. I'm an example of perseverance. In the face of 'you can't'. Aspirations of offering benefit through god misused. I've seen pictures of our love abiding long before I married. I had shot for the moon. What to do when they come true
2081,Alanis Morissette,Rock,My mind is invaded. My gates are ignored. My thoughts are negated. And you're on a roll. And I am offended. By your acts of shamelessness. Your lack of conscience. And your flagrant steamroll. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. My sorrow is lift off. My rages discounted. My fears are founded. This dam is no more. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. Don't touch me. My body is frozen. Thanks to you. And I've sat with these secrets. I'm no longer weighted. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?
2082,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Whenever we talk about sun all I see is the rain. It's like looking for tears in a ocean. I'm hearing your words like the wind. They blow straight through my heart. Will you ever give into emotion. And we hurt the ones that we love the most. Why we do only heaven knows. And I don't know why I'm still holding on...holding on. Chorus:. I reach in my heart to see. If your love is alive in me. But now I feel alone. My feelings turn to stone. My heart makes no apologies. When an apology's made it isn't always enough. To erase all the past in a moment. Whenever I need you the most. You always leave me behind. With a word from your lips I'm alone. You've been blind not to realize. All the love that I hold inside. So tell me why do I keep holding on...holding on. Repeat Chorus (x2). (And we hurt the ones that we love the most. Why we do only heaven knows. And I don't know why I'm still holding on...holding. on). What I need is your sympathy. Like a light flowing into me. Will I ever give up holding on... holding on.... Repeat Chorus
2083,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I don't want to be the filler if the void is solely yours. I don't want to be your glass of single malt whiskey. Hidden in the bottom drawer. I don't want to be the bandage if the wound is not mine. Lend me some fresh air. I don't want to be adored for what I merely represent to you. I don't want to be your babysitter. You're a very big boy now. I don't want to be you mother. I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months. Show me the back door. (chorus). Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at ten past six. Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh. Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom. You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor. I don't want to be the sweeper of the eggshells that you walk upon. I don't want to be your other half I believe that 1 and 1 make 2. I don't want to be your food or the light from the fridge on your face at midnight. Hey what are you hungry for. I don't want to be the glue that holds your pieces together. I don't want to be your idol. See this pedestal is high and I'm afraid of heights. I don't want to be lived through. A vicarious occasion. Please open the window. (repeat chorus). I don't want to live on someday when my motto is last week. I don't want to be responsible for your fractured heart and its wounded beat. I don't want to be a substitute for the smoke you've been inhaling. What do you thank me. What do you thank me for. (repeat chorus)
2084,Alanis Morissette,Rock,My name is Alanis. I'm a white chick singer. the drums are a-smokin' and so's the bass. Shake your thing. When you sing. just sixteen. no disco queen.

2085,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Why do I feel it's all up to me to see that. everything's right and it's how it should be. Why don't they just leave me alone. I've got to prove I can. Little girl with stars in her eyes they've. got her all figured out and there's nowhere. to hide why can't they all see who I am. when will they understand. It may take some time they don't know how. it feels because they can't read my mind. They always say I'm too young and they. feel they should help me. But I can make it all alone out here on my own. Every day I feel so in demand and all I. wish I could find is a place I can land. One day I'll feel comfort inside cause I'll. know who I am. I can hold the line if I know in the end. that I won't be left behind I don't regret. what I've done I don't think you can blame me. Now I'm standin' all alone out here on my own. I'm not thinking 'bout leavin' home. But I need to be on my own. Doesn't mean I have a heart of stone. I won't even ask them why. I can't ever let them see me cry. Here I'm standing all alone out here on my own.... out here on my own. Feeling lost in a world full of lies. I can't help thinkin' that love is just. passin' me by Hold on to what I believe. and keep an open hand. Can I have it all if there's no one to. turn to when I stumble and fall. Is there a secret I need because no one. has told me - all alone. It may take some time cause I know. how it feels to have a lot on your mind. I'll never feel all alone cause I. Know that I have me. Now I can make it all alone out here on my own. .
2086,Alanis Morissette,Rock,"""Bring on the Tequila oh. On fire on Tequila oh. My friends and I meet hours before. We make some home made pizza. We do some funny bits back and forth. My knees buckle I laugh so hard. We might end three sheets to wind. And who knows where we'll wind up. All I know is there?s a car waiting. And we?ll figure that out after. I have to keep my eye on my old friend from high school. We?ve known each other for the longest time. She has trouble with her dance so to speak. She can hoist a really good kick in the butt when she's excited. She doesn?t do it so much anymore. 'Cuz we?re all on to her. Bring on the Tequila oh. On fire on Tequila oh. Mostest most on Tequila oh. Bestest friends on Tequila oh. Then there?s my other pretty friend from high school. The predator in me is put to shame by the predator in her. and now i've reeled it in. It?ll be interesting to see how much she?s done as well. Then there?s my friend from Chigago. God do I love all people from Chicago. All ready to light up the barbeque. And be harping on debauchery. Bring on the Tequila oh. On fire on Tequila oh. Mostest most on Tequila oh. Bestest friends on Tequila oh. Then there?s my Canadian friend. What a fabulous mom she?s become. She?s been tortured in this sense. for the last many of months for obvious reasons. She was like """"hey where was this part of you when I wasn?t pregnant"""". I laughed and did a shot in her honor. As I conversed with her belly. Bring on the Tequila oh. On fire on Tequila oh. Mostest most on Tequila oh. Bestest friends on Tequila oh. Then there?s my Cupid friend. She sure knows how to dress that one. She?s a wise and worldly girl. But you gotta watch that medication. My favorite beverage is taken to a whole other level on it. I?m not worried about it or I?ll coast around the room. While I trust she?ll temper. My brother came to visit me. And now he?s used to hanging with me and cracking up. But he had no idea about my built up tolerance. No idea about how manipulative I?ve become. I would seruptitiously put it in front of him without him asking. In a pretty little shot glass. His smirk and cackle would only agg me on. Bring on the Tequila oh. On fire on Tequila oh. Mostest most on Tequila oh. Bestest friends on Tequila oh"""
2087,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I am the biggest hypocrite. I've been undeniably jealous. I have been loud and pretentious. I have been utterly threatened. I've gotten candy for my self-interest. The sexy treadmill capitalist. Heaven forbid I be criticized. Heaven forbid I be ignored. I have abused my power forgive me. you mean we actually are all one. one one one one one one one. I've been out of reach and separatist. Heaven forbid average (whatever average means). I have compensated for my. Days of powerlessness. I have abused my so-called power forgive me. You mean we actually are all one. one one one one one one one. Did you just call her amazing?. Surely we both can't be amazing!. And give up my hard earned status. As fabulous freak of nature?. I have abused my power forgive me. you mean we actually are all... one. one one one one one one one. Always looked good on paper. Sounded good in theory.
2088,Alanis Morissette,Rock,You'll rescue me right?. In the exact same way they never did. I'll be happy right? when your healing powers kick in. You'll complete me right?. Then my life can finally begin. I'll be worthy right?. Only when you realize the gem I am?. But this won't work now the way it once did. And I won't keep it up even though I would love to. Once I know who I'm not then I'll know who I am. But I know I won't keep on playing the victim. These precious illusions in my head. Did not let me down when I was defenseless. And parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends. This ring will help me yet. As will you knight in shining armor. This pill will help me yet. As will these boys gone through like water. But this won't work as well as the way it once did. Cuz I want to decide between survival and bliss. And though I know who I'm not I still don't know who I am. But I know I won't keep on playing the victim. These precious illusions in my head. Did not let me down when I was a kid. And parting with them is like parting with a childhood best friend. I've spent so long firmly looking outside me. I've spent so much time living in survival mode. This won't work now the way it once did. Cause I want to decide between survival and bliss. Now I know who I'm not I don't I still don't know who I am. But I know I won't keep on playing the victim. These precious illusions in my head. Did not let me down when I was defenseless. And parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends. These precious illusions in my head. Did not let me down when I was a kid. And parting with them is like parting with childhood best friends
2089,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Infatuation. Court well meant. 'Cause I'm the easiest to sway. Catch my fancy and commitment. Riding fresh can stay. One by one conditions change. Slippery slope yields sheckled face and. Gone are the days of snare and.... An omission to sexy hell. [Chorus:]. I don't my crown. And moniker claim is. Professional torturer. A sweet and comparer. I renounce my name. Professional torturer. Eyebrows raise and facades do fade. Poised refrained as.... Hands still hold but gazes abate. This masochism enfolds me. [Chorus ]. I don't my crown. And moniker claim is. Professional torturer. A sweet and comparer. I renounce my name. Professional torturer. I don't my crown. For you my boy I renounce my name. Professional torturer
2090,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Entertain me for the tenth hour in a row again. Anesthetize me with your gossip and many random anecdotes. And fill every hour with activity or ear candy. Drop me off at intersections in any city metropolitan. And keep me in this state. And keep me purgatorying. And sing me back to sleep. This is far more than I had bargained for. Start every week with a break-neck urgent design. And end every speed day with my briefcase representing free time. Spending my fruits my purchases become my lifeline. Please give my love to my family. I'll doubtfully be home at Christmas time. Don't disturb me in this state. Please leave me purgatorying. I'll be damned if I'm to wake. This is far more than I am equipped for. I've held you up like a deity. Like you're the sole owner of wings. This unrequited tunnel vision. And I wonder why I've not been writing. Please keep me in this state. Please keep me purgatorying. Please rock me back to sleep. This love is more than - than I have bargained for. I'll be damned if I'm to wake. This is far more than I'm equipped for

2093,Alanis Morissette,Rock,You've been my golden best friend. And now with post - demise at hand. I can't go to you for consolation. Cause we're off limits during this transition. This grief overwhelms me. It burns in my stomach. And I can't stop bumping into things. I thought we'd be simple together. I thought we'd be happy together. Thought we'd be limitless together. I thought we'd be precious together. But I was sadly mistaken. You've been my soulmate and than some. I remembered you the moment I met you. With you I knew God's face was handsome. With you I saw fun and expansion. This loss is numbing me. It pierces my chest. And I can't stop dropping everything. I thought we'd be sexy together. Thought we'd be evolving together. I thought we'd have children together. I thought we'd be family together. But I was sadly mistaken. If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared. If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented. If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air. My wealth would render this no less severe. I thought we'd be genius together. I thought we'd be healing together. I thought we'd be growing together. Thought we'd be adventurous together. But I was sadly mistaken. Thought we'd be exploring together. Thought we'd be inspired together. I thought we'd be flying together. Thought we'd be on fire together. But I was sadly mistaken. (vocalizes)
2094,Alanis Morissette,Rock,You and me we're cut from the same cloth. It seems to some we famously get along. But you and me are strangers to each other. Cuz you and me: competitive to the bone. Such tragedy to trample on each other with how much. We've endured. With the state this land is in. You and me feel joined by only gender. We are not all for one and one for all. Sister blister we fight to please the brothers. We think their acceptance is how we win. They're happy we're climbing over each other. To beg the club of boys to let us in. You and me estranged from the mother. You and me have felt impotent in our skin. You and me have taken it out on each other. You and me disloyal to the feminine. Such a pity to disavow each other with how far we've come. With how strong we've been. You and me are on this pendulum together. You and me with scarcity still fueling. Sister blister we fight to please the brothers. We think their acceptance is how we win. They're happy we're climbing over each other. To beg the club of boys to let us in. We may not have priorities same. We may not even like each other. We may not be hugely anti-men. But such a cost to dishonor a sister. You and me have made it harder for the other. We forget how hard separatism has been. You and me we can help change their minds together. You and me in alignment until the end. Sister blister we fight to please the brothers. We think their acceptance is how we win. They're happy we're climbing over each other. To beg the club of boys to let us in
2095,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Oh these little rejections how they add up quickly. One small sideways look and I feel so ungood. Somewhere along the way I think I gave you the powerto make. Me feel the way I thought only my father could. Oh these little rejections how they seem so real to me. One forgotten birthday I'm all but cooked. How these little abandonments seem to sting so easily. I'm 13 again am I 13 for good?. I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful. So unloved for someone so fine. I can feel so boring for someone so interesting. So ignorant for someone of sound mind. Oh these little protections how they fail to serve me. One forgotten phone call and I'm deflated. Oh these little defenses how they fail to comfort me. Your hand pulling away and I'm devastated. I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful. So unloved for someone so fine. I can feel so boring for someone so interesting. So ignorant for someone of sound mind. When will you stop leaving baby?. When will I stop deserting baby?. When will I start staying with myself?. Oh these little projections how they keep springing from me. I jump my ship as I take it personally. Oh these little rejections how they disappear quickly. The moment I decide not to abandon me
2096,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I could be daydreaming but for a moment. And somehow they're creeping back in. I could be sleeping and wake in a torrent. Somehow I get caught in their grips again. Here I am in my shame spiral. I'm sucked into it again. I reach out for your benevolent opinion. And you bring the light back in. Don't leave me here with all these critical voices. Cuz they do their best to bring me down bring me down. When I'm alone with all these negative voices. I will need your help to turn them down turn them 'round. I could be listening to a conversation. A story I'm not even in. These voices have their way when I am unguarded. Suddenly I step in quicksand again. Once again in my shame spiral. I am glad that you've weighed in. Don't leave me here with all these critical voices. Cuz they do their best to bring me down bring me down. When I'm alone with all these negative voices. I will need your help to turn them down turn them 'round. All these judgments so incisive. Voices left to their devices. This woman's neuroses a desperate plea. For slack to be cut to me...cut to me. Don't leave me here with all these critical voices. Cuz they do their best to bring me down bring me down. When I'm alone with all these negative voices. I will need your help to turn them down turn them 'round

2099,Alanis Morissette,Rock,How about getting off of these antibiotics. How about stopping eating when I'm full up. How about them transparent dangling carrots. How about that ever elusive kudo. Thank you India. Thank you terror. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you frailty. Thank you consequence. Thank you thank you silence. How about me not blaming you for everything. How about me enjoying the moment for once. How about how good it feels to finally forgive you. How about grieving it all one at a time. Thank you India. Thank you terror. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you frailty. Thank you consequence. Thank you thank you silence. The moment I let go of it was. The moment I got more than I could handle. The moment I jumped off of it was. The moment I touched down. How about no longer being masochistic. How about remembering your divinity. How about unabashedly bawling your eyes out. How about not equating death with stopping. Thank you India. Thank you providence. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you nothingness. Thank you clarity. Thank you thank you silence. yeah yeah. ahh ohhh. ahhh ho oh. ahhh ho ohhhhhh. yeaahhhh yeahh
2100,Alanis Morissette,Rock,That I would be good. Even if I did nothing. That I would be good. Even if I got the thumbs down. That I would be good. If I got and stayed sick. That I would be good. Even if I gained 10 pounds. That I would be fine. Even if I went bankrupt. That I would be good. If I lost my hair and my youth. That I would be great. If I was no longer queen. That I would be grand. If I was not all knowing. That I would be loved. Even when I numb myself. That I would be good. Even when I am overwhelmed. That I would be loved. Even when I was fuming. That I would be good. Even if I was clinging. That I would be good. Even if I lost sanity. That I would be good. Whether with or without you
2101,Alanis Morissette,Rock,If somebody asked you to surrender. And that was the only way to win. If somebody offered you the freedom to open. Your mind again. Would you take that flight. Would you walk right in. So meet me down at the bottom line. And open my heart with your hands. And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling. And find where the truth has been. Down at the bottom line. If somebody led you to the water. If somebody taught you (right?) how to swim. If somebody took your doubt and turned it out. And then you could breathe again. Would you take that chance. Would you dive right in. So meet me down at the bottom line. And open my heart with your hands. And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling. And find where the truth has been. Down at the bottom line. What if the wind blows. The cradle will fall. What if the wise man knows nothing at all. We justify. We crucify. But we don't have the balls to cry. So meet me down at the bottom line. And open my heart with your hands. And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling. And find where the truth has been. Down at the bottom line. That's where we'll go. Where truth always flows
2102,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I am a man as a man I've been told. Bacon is brought to the house in this mold. Born of your bellies I yearn for the cord. Years I have groveled repentance ignored. And I have been blamed. And I have repented. I'm working my way toward our union mended. I am man who has grown from a son. Been crucified by enraged women. I am son who was raised by such men. I'm often reminded of the fools I'm among. And I have been shamed. And I have relented. I'm working my way toward our union mended. And I have been shamed. And I have repented. I'm working my way toward our union mended. we don't fare well with endless reprimands. we don't do well with a life served as a sentence. this won't work well if you're hell bent on your offence. I am a man who understands your resistance. I am a man who still does what he can. to dispel our archaic reputation. I am a man who has heard all he can. cuz I don't fare well with endless punishment. Cuz I have been blamed and I have repented. I'm working my way toward our union mended. And we have been blamed and we have repented. I'm working my way toward our union mended
2103,Alanis Morissette,Rock,These are the thoughts that go through my head in my. Backyard on a Sunday afternoon. When I have the house to myself and I'm not expending. All that energy on fighting with my boyfriend. Is he the one that I will marry?. Why is it so hard to be objective about myself?. Why do I feel cellularly alone?. Am I supposed to live in this crazy city?. Can blindly continued fear. Induced regurgitated life-denying tradition be overcome?. Where does the money go that I send to those in need?. If we have so much why do some people have nothing still?. Why do I feel frantic when I first wake up in the morning?. Why do you say you are spiritual yet you treat people like shit?. How can you say you're close to god and yet you talk behind. My back as though I am not a part of you?. Why do I say I'm fine when it's obvious I'm not?. Why's it so hard to tell you what I want?. Why can't you just read my mind?. Why do I fear that the quieter I am the. less you will listen?. Why do I care whether you like me or not?. Why is it so hard for me to be angry?. Why is it such work to stay conscious and. So easy to get stuck and not the other way around?. Will I ever move back to canada?. Can I be with a lover with whom I am a student and. a master?. Why am I encouraged to shut my mouth when it gets too. close to home?. Why cannot I live in the moment?
2104,Alanis Morissette,Rock,Like anyone would be. I am flattered by your fascination with me. Like any hot blooded woman. I have simply wanted an object to crave. But you you're not allowed. You're uninvited. An unfortunate slight. Must be strangely exciting. To watch the stoic squirm. Must be somewhat heartening. To watch them burn me shepherd. But you you're not allowed. You're uninvited. An unfortunate slight. Like any uncharted territory. I must seem greatly intriguing. You speak of my love like. You have experienced love like mine before. But this is not allowed. You're uninvited. An unfortunate slight. I don't think you unworthy. I need a moment to deliberate
2105,Alanis Morissette,Rock,"""Burn the books they've got too many names and psychoses. All this incriminating evidence would surely. haunt me. If someone broke into my house. Suits in the living room. Do you realize guys I was born in 1974. We've got someone here to explain your publishing. We know how much you love to be in front of audiences. Hopeful you are. Schoolbound you are. Naive you are. Driven you are. Take a trip to New York with your guardian. And your fake identification. When they said """"Is there something anything. you'd like to know young lady?"""". You said """"Yes I'd like to know what kind of people. I'll be dealing with"""". Precocious you are. Headstrong you are. Terrified you are. Ahead of your time you are. Don't mind our staring but. We're surprised you're not in a far-gone asylum. We're surprised you didn't crack up. Lord knows that we would've. We would've liked to have been there. But you keep pushing us away. Resilient you are. Big time you are. Ruthless you are. Precious you are"""
2106,Alanis Morissette,Rock,We'd gather around all in a room. fasten our belts engage in dialogue. We'd all slow down rest without guilt. Not lie without fear disagree sans judgement. We would stay and respond and expand. And include and allow and forgive and. Enjoy and evolve and discern. And inquire and accept and admit. and divulge and. Open and reach out and. speak up. This is utopia this is my utopia. This is my ideal my end in sight. Utopia this is my utopia. This is my nirvana. My ultimate. We'd open our arms we'd all jump in we'd all coast. down into safety nets. We would share and listen and support. and welcome be propelled by passion not. Invest in outcomes we would breathe. and be charmed and amused by difference. Be gentle and make room for every emotion. This is utopia this is my utopia. This is my ideal my end in sight. Utopia this is my utopia. This is my nirvana. My ultimate. We'd provide forums we'd all speak out. we'd all be heard we'd all feel seen. We'd rise post-obstacle more defined. more grateful we would heal be humbled. And be unstoppable we'd hold close. and let go and know when to do which we'd. Release and disarm and stand up and. feel safe. This is utopia this is my utopia. This is my ideal my end in sight. Utopia this is my utopia. This is my nirvana. My ultimate

2108,Alanis Morissette,Rock,First woman down was your mother. She did condone how you behave. All you could see was your father. His disrespect was in her face. Next woman down was your sister. Her silence did corroborate. She took her cues from the climate. And never knew another way. Who do you take me for. Calling all woman haters. We've lowered the bar on the. Behavior that we will take --come on now. Calling all lady haters. Why must you vilify us. Are you willing to clean the slate?. Woman down. Next woman down was your lover. She takes your spite at value face. Even her hair length and color. Gives you the impulse to repeat. Who do you take me for. Calling all woman haters. We've lowered the bar on the. Behavior that we will take?come on now. Calling all lady haters. Why must you vilify us. Are you willing to clean the slate?. Woman down. Next woman down is your daughter. A stranger to being debased. She has a new lease and limit. On the abuse she'll tolerate. Who do you take me for. Calling all woman haters. We've lowered the bar on the. Behavior that we will take?come on now. Calling all lady haters. Why must you vilify us. Are you willing to clean the slate?. Woman down
2109,Alanis Morissette,Rock,I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone. I recommend walking around naked in your living room. Swallow it down (what a jagged little pill). It feels so good (swimming in your stomach). Wait until the dust settles. (chorus). You live you learn. You love you learn. You cry you learn. You lose you learn. You bleed you learn. You scream you learn. I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone. I certainly do. I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time. Feel free. Throw it down (the caution blocks you from the wind). Hold it up (to the rays). You wait and see when the smoke clears. (repeat chorus). Wear it out (the way a three-year-old would do). Melt it down (you're gonna have to eventually anyway). The fire trucks are coming up around the bend. (repeat chorus). You grieve you learn. You choke you learn. You laugh you learn. You choose you learn. You pray you learn. You ask you learn. You live you learn
2110,Alejandro Escovedo,Rock,Have another drink on me. I've been empty since Arizona. I turned my back on me. And I faced the face. Of who I thought I was. One kiss just led to another. One kiss just fades into love. Blow another smoke ring for me. I've been straight. So straight since Arizona. You say I've lost my way. But it's all a dream. Since Arizona. One kiss just led into another. One kiss just fades into lover. Arizona. Have another drink on me. I've been empty since Arizona. I turned my back on me. And I faced the face. Of who I thought I was. One kiss just led to another. One kiss just fades into love. Arizona. Arizona. Arizona
2111,Alejandro Escovedo,Rock,Dear head on the wall. Look until. You're too simple. And the softness. Of knowing hurts. And the softness. Of knowing hurts. Dear head on the wall. Afraid. To mention the deaths. That I can't stuff. Into my mouth. That I can't stuff. Into my mouth. All the longing that is. A pity pretty pin. A pity pretty pin. And the sadness will come. When there is no one. Dear head on the wall. Forget what we already know. Hang a picture of your heart. Bandaged in surgeon's bowl. Opened up to it all. A pity pretty pin. A pity pretty pin
2112,Alejandro Escovedo,Rock,I believe. All that you've written. I believe all that you know. Has somehow been mistaken. For the truth inside this show. We weren't looking for love. We weren't looking for love. Two strangers make a fire. Wrap themselves in heat. And feed off their desire. As they watch the desert sleep. They weren't looking for love. They weren't looking for love. One true love. One true love. One true love. They say the party's over. The sacrifice complete. I'm feeling so much older. Since we drank up all the heat. We weren't looking for love. We weren't looking for love. One true love. One true love. One true love
2113,Alejandro Escovedo,Rock,When I turn twenty-one. I'm gonna make a change. Turn my back on what I was. And make you proud. Of what I'm not. If it's my life. Why tear it down. And make me feel this way. I do my best. With what I've got. Why do you tear it down?. Mama's not talkin' now. Dad. He's fallen off the track. Sister's on a rampage. And brother. He's planning. His silent attack. My family's up and moved away. They couldn't stand the heat. Why build a house. Just to burn it down. Another love-torn mystery. You take a nickel and a spoon. And a crooked lover's tune. Might not add up to much. Just a nickel and a spoon
2114,Alejandro Escovedo,Rock,The interview. Where you spoke. To the bleach. In the stone. You should have. Brought some tea. Outside. Where the light. Coats us. In marzipan. In pools. Of breast milk. I had to bury. My daughter today. And I can't. Think about. It too much. You see a buck. From the sky. Trample. A wandering doe. You see a buck. From the sky. Trample. A wandering doe. I am down. To the beach. Smoke condensed. From telling stories. Strolling through. The neighborhood. Clanking steel. And discolored. Because you made. A truce of rubber. Because you made. A truce of rubber. Because you made. A truce of rubber. Because you made. A truce of rubber. You see a buck. From the sky. Trample. A wandering doe. You see a buck. From the sky. Trample. A wandering doe. Abiding in the unborn. Is symmetry. And that one is always. The refuge. Abiding in the unborn. Is symmetry. And that one is always. The refuge. You see a buck. From the sky. Trample. A wandering doe
2115,Alejandro Escovedo,Rock,Some people say the world's a strange and evil place. And all the shadows fall across your face. Because the world's a strange and evil place. Then others say because the sun shines every day. That we should live life come what may. Because the sun shines every day. But i gotta say. That i just can't put you down. And all the girls think i'm insane. You know i can't put you down. And my dad can't recall my name. But i just can't put you down. And my friends won't call back at all. But i just can't put you down. Some people say. If you feed a dog a bloody bone. He's your best friend for your life. If you feed a dog a bloody bone. Patch up your dreams. With all the gold that falls at your feet. Stick your finger in a dike. All the gold falls at your feet. And i want to say. You know i just can't put you down. And all the women think that i'm insane. You know i just can't put you down. And my mom won't call back at all. You know i just can't put you down. I rub my wounds with alcohol. You know i just can't put you down. I just can't put you down. There ain't a pill that'll cure that pain. But i just can't put you down. Some people say. That money can buy anything. All the drugs to cure the pain. Money can buy anything. Then some people want. All the sin and pleasure in this world. They don't care about the price. They pay for all the sin and pleasure in this world. But i've gotta say. You know i just can't put you down. I don't care how far i fall. You know i just can't put you down. And i don't care if they call back at all. I just can't put you down. All the women can forget my name. You know i just can't put you down. You know i just can't put you down. You know i just can't put you down. You know i just can't put you down
2116,Alejandro Escovedo,Rock,Nobody left unbroken. Nobody left unscared. Nobody here is talking. That's just. The way things are. You had to go without me. You wander off alone. And all the neon light. Reflects off the sidewalk. Over'n reminds me. You're not coming home. (Over'n??). Sister lost soul. Brother lost soul. I need you. Sister lost soul. Brother lost soul. I need you. Every last heart. Is hardened. An' every last tears'. Been cried. Out on the street. The water is frozen. And I feel like. The only one alive. Sister lost soul. Brother lost soul. I need you. Sister lost soul. Brother lost soul. I need you. I long to lay down. Beside you. Feel your breath. In my ear. You're not. The first or last. I've lied to. I'm lyin'. To myself right now. You're still here. Sister lost soul. Brother lost soul. I need you. Sister lost soul. Brother lost soul. I need you. Sister lost soul. Brother lost soul. I need you. Sister lost soul. Brother lost soul
2117,Alejandro Escovedo,Rock,I saw the good son. Waling with leo canton. Down the boulevard. With leo canton. His beginning froze. As he took a jab. I saw the good son. As the underground hall of fame. I saw the good son. On the arm of a princess. His beginning froze. Under the weight of the sea. I saw the good son. On the arm of a princess. She was wise and strong. Sit out the raging sea. No more the good son. He lost his sense of space. His beginning froze. Under the weight of the sun. No more the good son. Just walking around. He's looking for leo canton
2118,Alice In Chains,Rock,We chase misprinted lies. We face the path of time. And yet I fight. And yet I fight. This battle all alone. No one to cry to. No place to call home. My gift of self is raped. My privacy is raked. And yet I find. And yet I find. Repeating in my head. If I can't be my own. I'd feel better dead
2119,Alice In Chains,Rock,Frozen in the place I hide. Not afraid to paint my sky with. Some who say I've lost my mind. Brother try and hope to find. You were always so far away. I know that pain so don't you run away. Like you used to do. Roses in a vase of white. Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves. That fall because my hand is. Pulling them hard as I can. You were always so far away. I know that pain and I won't run away. Like I used to do. Pictures in a box at home. Yellowing and green with mold. So I can barely see your face. Wonder how that color taste. You were always so far away. I know the way so don't you run away. Like you used to do. Like you used to do.
2120,Alice In Chains,Rock,You tried to kill me off. Surprised I remain. A scale tips impossible. Afraid of my own name. And I always paid attention to all the lines you crossed. Forgive this imperfection it shows and know. I am the child that lives and cries in a corner. Dies in a corner. Alone inside your mind. Intend obsolescence. Built into the system. I tried to shake it off. You can't remove this stain. A scale breaks impossible. Afraid we are the same. And you never paid attention to all the lines I crossed. Forgive this imperfection it shows and know. I am the child that lives and cries in a corner. Dies in a corner. Alone inside your mind. Hides in a corner. Dies in a corner. Alone inside your mind. Intend obsolescence. Built into the system
2121,Alice In Chains,Rock,Frozen in the place I hide. Not afraid to paint my sky with. Some who say I've lost my mind. Brother try and hope to find. You were always so far away. I know that pain so don't you run away. Like you used to do. Roses in a vase of white. Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves. That fall because my hand is. Pulling them hard as I can. You were always so far away. I know that pain and I won't run away. Like I used to do. Pictures in a box at home. Yellowing and green with mold. So I can barely see your face. Wonder how that color taste. You were always so far away. I know the way so don't you run away. Like you used to do. Like you used to do.
2122,Alice In Chains,Rock,Sinking below view. Time spent a wasting. Alone in a full room. Nobody plays in. I own everything. Whine all set on eleven. I own everything. Cries a soul on fire. Hurt does surround you. Blinded and tied on. Numbness engulfs truth. Let bygones be bygones. I own everything. Whine all set on eleven. I own everything. Cries a soul on fire. And it tears me in a way. Hangin' over. And I feel it's here to stay. Inner coldness so ingrained. Feel like a fake thing. Where did the time go?. Memories worth making. Pass by the window. I own everything. Whine all set on eleven. I own everything. Cries a soul on fire. Soul on fire
2123,Alice In Chains,Rock,I could climb until I reach where angels reside. Ask around to find out where the junkies apply. You just up and left me on this rock all alone. It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known. Ohhhhhhhh. My heart is dried up beating slow. Ohhhhhh. It's been just raining since you died. Died. Since you died. You died. I could drop until I touch the sinister side. Visit all attractions flippin' back and aside. Still you leave me rotting on this rock all alone. It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known. Ohhhhhhhh. My heart is dried up beating slow. Ohhhhhh. It's been just raining since you died. Died. Since you died. You died. Ohhhhhhh. My heart is tired of beating slow. Ohhhhhh. It's been just raining since you died. Died. Since you died. You died. I could climb until I reach where angels reside. I could drop until I touch the sinister side. Ohhhhhhhh. My heart is dried up beating slow. Ohhhhh. It's been just raining since you died. Died. Since you died. You died. Died. You died. Died. You died.

Are you full and strong?. Gonna end up in this cage. And I hope you stay as long.... I know. Won't forget. Limped away. From the wreck. We'll never know what this is. Till we take a look inside.

2128,Alice In Chains,Rock,There's no reason. To deny. It's the season. Of the lie. Having someone. Grin at you. Look at little fingers. Pointing truth. Man it's a weight on my mind. And that's fine. But now we wade past the point of decline. There's no time. I'm a believer. In the new. Past receiver. All come true. Look to the east. Filled with hate. Neutral flashers. While we wait. Man it's a weight on my mind. And that's fine. But now we wade past the point of decline. There's no time. I'm an old lover. You're so sane. Who's the answer. Of what I mean. In this ocean. I fell into. Break me out of. The shell I grew. Man it's a weight on my mind. And that's fine. But now we wade past the point of decline. There's no time. There's no time. (There's no time).

2129,Alice In Chains,Rock,We chase misprinted lies. We face the path of time. And yet I fight. And yet I fight. This battle all alone. No one to cry to. No place to call home. My gift of self is raped. My privacy is raked. And yet I find. And yet I find. Repeating in my head. If I can't be my own. I'd feel better dead
2130,Alice In Chains,Rock,No hope of rescue. I'm trapped here alone. If I don't dig my own way out I'll die here. Gave my loyalty too soon. Now the fork-tongued viper's dead. Is dead yeah yeah. Weather is shiftin'. So cold goin' up. Through a pinhole of light I see vultures circlin'. Bottom feeders dig my skin. Winner bring a parasite. With him. Weak or pulverized. No better medicine. Angels have been advised. Don't want no requiem. I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb. I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb. Gonna wear you like a second skin. I'll haunt you like a phantom limb. (Solo). Every new second. Getting harder to break. No matter which side I end up on. This ain't over. My regrets are very true. Still so much was lies (again?). By you. Weak or pulverized. No better medicine. Angels have been advised. Don't want no requiem. I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb. I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb. Gonna wear you like a second skin. I'll haunt you like a phantom limb
2131,Alice In Chains,Rock,I survive on the scraps you don't burn. Maybe love's something I'll never learn. This whole house all cut from red stone. If I disappear would you even know. The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive. The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive. So far under. Far I've never fell. Now forever dwell. So far under. So far under. Too much pain to tell. And now I've reeled us under. So far under. All my words start screaming to the boy. Same black hole where my heart was destroyed.

2134,Alice In Chains,Rock,The face before me flies. laughs at me inside. masks are made to hide the glow. shining eyes. distance 'tween us grows. feeding lies. it's hard to start things over. you can feel the fire around us. all the time. yeah. something I should say. it takes you every day. what you give is not alive. today. your soul served on a plate. throw it away. it's hard to start things over. you can feel the fire around us. all the time. yeah. it's hard to start things over. oh yeah. you can feel the fire around us. all the time. yeah. it's hard to start things over. oh yeah. you can feel the fire around us. all the time. yeah. all the time. what the hell have I?. little pride
2135,Am,Rock,In the hallway. A seed was sewn. Into the mind of a complete unknown. Then a story. Which was never known. Rose to the surface. And soon took hold. Like a battle. You just can't win. What you've kept out. You now let in. And the secrets of a convenient friend. Bringing you back. Again and again. Back and fourth from what you think is right. Time could heal the things you feel tonight. So wake up. Put on a new face. Following through. With agreements made. But a feeling. You just can't name. Is taking control. Of what you do and say. Back and fourth from what you think is right. Time could heal the things you feel tonight. Roads signal decay. When you're torn between your words. You cannot be saved. This is something you own. You won't get no sympathy. Try if you want but it won't be free. From the shadows. You just can't see. Desire and need. Almost never agree
2136,Am,Rock,sit in back rows. with nothing to say. born into headphones. running away. you needed someone. to turn you around. you couldn't make it alone. come get what you wanted. there's nothing denied. you're at the center. of everyone's eye. places we're going. you wouldn't believe. you are my ultimate prize. in the light. city boy is blind. wanted for your style. silly boy you. now you'll be my lady. living in my city. i'm waiting now my lady. it's time for you to pay your dues. in the light. city boy is blind. wanted for your style. i'm waiting for you
2137,Am,Rock,Looking out at the city so bright. Not sure if it’s imagined or real. Show me something that you’d always want to hide. And then we’ll get away. You always wanted to say what you feel. But all those right hands keep telling you wrong. Got another who’s just stepping on your heels. Got to get away. Get away from. All these troubled and all of these lies. Find yourself a reason. Leave tonight. Take your chances. Feeling alright. And then we’ll fade away. Fade away tonight. Helpless highways looking alone. Seen nothing but the worst of your times. All in all it ‘s got you climbing up the walls. You gotta get away. Get away from. All these troubled and all of these lies. Find yourself a reason. Leave tonight. Take your chances. Feeling alright. And then we’ll fade away. Fade away tonight
2138,Am,Rock,what's your name. do you feel the same. up all night. think about our lives. when we're gone. our ghosts live on. so have we tried. have we done our best. to turn the wrong into right. turn the wrong into right. turn the dark into light. we divide. sacrifice our lives. over what we're told. over what they hide. we don't want. to go unsung. give us your faith. cuz it's not too late. to turn the wrong into right. turn the wrong into right. turn the dark into light. light. light. light. and we'll be alright. right. right. right. right. right. right. right
2139,Am,Rock,I sit around. Nothing?s the same. I?m looking for answers. But I?m already late. You say you need me. One more night'. Then you?re packing your bags. Saying it?s all right. I don?t know why. I wait and I wait. I?m looking for something. But you?re not gonna change. Turn around and I see the hope fading. Now you?ve gone away. Keep on moving like you?re so unaware. You?re looking for answers but you?re already there. You see the road but you don?t the way. You?re coming around and then you?re pulling away. i don?t know why I wait and I wait. I?m looking for something but you?re not gonna change. Turn around and I see the hope fading. Now you?ve gone away
2140,Am,Rock,Waiting for the sun to rise. Was it something I said. Feeling all that is right and wrong. Mixing up in my head. Won’t you just let me come around. Cuz you know that I can. Bring me back to just what I know. A home. I’m alone. All troubled pass in time. And we can make it through. You tell me that it’s not what I say. But what I can do. I can’t make it alone. I want to come home. Blinded by these city lights. Now they just got in the way. And it’s so lonely this evening town. It makes no sense anyway. Now it’s what you say that I’m riding on. Cuz all those times I let you down. You were there to stay. All troubles pass in time. And we can make it through. You tell me that it’s not what I say. But what I can do. I can’t make it alone. I want to come home
2141,Am,Rock,Did I tell you I knew your name. But it seems that I've lost it. Did I tell you it's my own game. This is not your problem. I don't know if I'm gonna change. Wasting time and another day. I keep running away. Even from the good things. Did I tell you it's not that bad. Sitting over here dreaming. Did I tell you Im right on track. This time I mean it. I don't know if I'm gonna change. Wasting time and another day. I keep running away. Even from the good things
2142,Am,Rock,don't you know that i need somebody. need somebody like you. don't you know that i need somebody. need somebody that's true. it's a miracle you need someone. you need someone too. cuz i know that i need somebody. need somebody like you. and you know we all need somebody. need someone to make it through. in the end we all leave somebody. so love someone until you do
2143,Am,Rock,Waiting. You sit alone. Feelings have all faded. You're wondering why you have stayed. You're looking for some answers. Hoping there's some other way. Just tell me when you're ready. We'll get you far far away. Far from these troubled times. Looking at the way you stand and fall. Seems like everything you've had is gone. Tell me that you've heard this all before. I'll say it anyway. Leave this. You've seen that road. Just find another city. Get this out of your way. You're hiding out wondering. How to get rid of this pain. You talk a bunch of nothing. Seems so easy to see. You've seen enough troubled times
2144,Apoema,Rock,Eu fui o primeiro a ver. Que é impossível não te ler. Palavras correm pra você. Sempre tem algo a dizer. Porquê. Não. Esperar. Por você. Pra viver. A felicidade em si. Consome até o que perdi. O tempo não vai parar. Vale a pena te olhar. Porquê. Não. Esperar. Por você. Porquê. Não. Esperar. Por você. Pra viver
2145,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,I wanna be your vacuum cleaner. Breathing in your dust. I wanna be your Ford Cortina. I will never rust. If you like your coffee hot. let me be your coffee pot. You call the shots babe. I just wanna be yours. Secrets I have held in my heart. Are harder to hide than I thought. Maybe I just wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. Let me be your 'leccy meter. And I'll never run out. Let me be the portable heater. That you'll get cold without. I wanna be your setting lotion. (wanna be). Hold your hair in deep devotion. (how deep?). At least as deep as the Pacific ocean. I wanna be yours. Secrets I have held in my heart. Are harder to hide than I thought. Maybe I just wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be yours. I wanna be your vacuum cleaner. (I wanna be yours). Breathing in your dust. (I wanna be yours). I wanna be your Ford Cortina. (I wanna be yours). I will never rust. (I wanna be yours). I just wanna be yours. (I wanna be yours). I just wanna be yours. (I wanna be yours). I just wanna be yours. (I wanna be yours)
2146,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,One for the road. Ooh ooh. One for the road. Ooh ooh. From the bottom of your heart. The relegation zone. Saw this comin' from the start. The shake rattle and roll. The craks in blackout blinds. Cats patterns on the ceiling. But you're feeling fine. I thought it was dark outside. I thought it was dark outside. One for the road. So we all get back to yours. And you sit and talk to me on the floor. There's no need to show me round. Baby I feel like I've been here before. I've been wonderin' whether later. When you've told everybody to go. Will you pour me one for the road?. I knew this would be on the cards. I knew you wouldn't fold. I saw this comin' from the start. The shake rattle and roll. One for the road. So we all get back to yours. And you sit and talk to me on the floor. There's no need to show me round. Baby I feel like I've been here before. I've been wonderin' whether later. When you've told everybody to go. Will you pour me one for the road?. The mixture hits you hard. Don't get that sinking feeling. Don't fall apart. Some out of tune guitar. Soundtrack to disaster. Ooh ooh. One for the road. So we all get back to yours. And you sit and talk to me on the floor. There's no need to show me round. Baby I feel like I've been here before. I've been wonderin' whether later. When you've told everybody to go. Will you pour me one for the road?
2147,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,You got the lights on in the afternoon. And the nights are drawn out long. And you're kissing to cut through the gloom. With a cough drop coloured tongue. And you were sitting in the corner. With the coats all piled high. And I thought you might be mine. In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night. In the right place and time. When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock. When you know who's calling. Even though the number is blocked. When you walked around your house. Wearing my sky blue Lacoste. And your knee socks. Well you cured my January blues. Yeah you made it all alright. I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse. That you were trying not to light. You were a stranger in my phonebook. I was acting like I knew. 'Cause I had nothing to lose. When the winter's in full swing. And your dreams just aren't coming true. Ain't it funny what you'll do. When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock. When you know who's calling. Even though the number is blocked. When you walked around your house. Wearing my sky blue Lacoste. And your knee socks. The late afternoon. The ghost in your room. That you always thought didn't approve. Of you knocking boots. Never stopped you letting me get hold. Of the sweet spot by the scruff of your. Knee socks. You and me could have been a team. Each had a half of a king and queen seat. Like the beginning of Mean Streets. She could be my baby. (All the zeros lined up but the number's blocked. When you've come undone). When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock. When you know who's calling. Even though the number is blocked. When you walked around your house. Wearing my sky blue Lacoste. And your knee socks
2148,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,Jesus in the day spa filling out the information form. Mama got her hair done. Just popping out to sing a protest song. I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade. where I ponder all the questions. but just manage to miss the mark. Good afternoon. Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino. Mark speaking. Please tell me how may I direct your call?. This magical thinking. Feels as if it really might catch on. Mama wants some answers. Do you remember where it all went wrong?. Technological advances. Really bloody get me in the mood. Pull me in close on a crisp eve baby. Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob. Good afternoon. Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino. Mark speaking. Please tell me how may I direct your call?. Do you celebrate your dark side. Then wish you'd never left the house?. Have you ever spent a generation. trying to figure that one out?. Good afternoon. Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino. Mark speaking. Please tell me how may I direct your call?
2149,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,I can't explain but I want to try. There's this image of you and I. And it goes dancing by in the morning. And in the night time. There's all these secrets that I can't keep. Like in my heart there's that hotel suite. And you lived there so long. It's kinda strange now you're gone. I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found. Has it gone for good?. Or is it coming back around?. Isn't it hard to make up your mind?. When you're losing and your fuse is fireside. There's all those places we used to go. And I suspect you already know. But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same. But something about it's changed. I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found. Has it gone for good?. Or is it coming back around?. Isn't it hard to make up your mind?. When you're losing and your fuse is fireside. And I thought I was yours forever. Maybe I was mistaken. But I just cannot manage to make it through the day. Without thinking of you lately. I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found. Has it gone for good?. Or is it coming back around?. Isn't it hard to make up your mind?.

2150,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,He knew what he wanted to say. But he did not want to word it. The dirty little Herbert. Was thinking an escape. But the place was well guarded. The guiltiness that started. Soon as the other part had stopped. D is for Delightful. And try and keep your trousers on. I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare. D is for. Desperately trying to stimulate what it was that was alright. 3 quarters of an hour ago. That had led him to be in a position. And every compromission. On every other episode.

2151,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,I can't explain but I want to try. There's this image of you and I. And it goes dancing by in the morning. And in the night time. There's all these secrets that I can't keep. Like in my heart there's that hotel suite. And you lived there so long. It's kinda strange now you're gone. I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found. Has it gone for good?. Or is it coming back around?. Isn't it hard to make up your mind?. When you're losing and your fuse is fireside. There's all those places we used to go. And I suspect you already know. But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same. But something about it's changed. I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found. Has it gone for good?. Or is it coming back around?. Isn't it hard to make up your mind?. When you're losing and your fuse is fireside. And I thought I was yours forever. Maybe I was mistaken. But I just cannot manage to make it through the day. Without thinking of you lately. I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found. Has it gone for good?. Or is it coming back around?. Isn't it hard to make up your mind?. When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

2153,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,You got the lights on in the afternoon. And the nights are drawn out long. And you're kissing to cut through the gloom. With a cough drop coloured tongue. And you were sitting in the corner. With the coats all piled high. And I thought you might be mine. In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night. In the right place and time. When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock. When you know who's calling. Even though the number is blocked. When you walked around your house. Wearing my sky blue Lacoste. And your knee socks. Well you cured my January blues. Yeah you made it all alright. I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse. That you were trying not to light. You were a stranger in my phonebook. I was acting like I knew. 'Cause I had nothing to lose. When the winter's in full swing. And your dreams just aren't coming true. Ain't it funny what you'll do. When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock. When you know who's calling. Even though the number is blocked. When you walked around your house. Wearing my sky blue Lacoste. And your knee socks. The late afternoon. The ghost in your room. That you always thought didn't approve. Of you knocking boots. Never stopped you letting me get hold. Of the sweet spot by the scruff of your. Knee socks. You and me could have been a team. Each had a half of a king and queen seat. Like the beginning of Mean Streets. She could be my baby. (All the zeros lined up but the number's blocked. When you've come undone). When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock. When you know who's calling. Even though the number is blocked. When you walked around your house. Wearing my sky blue Lacoste. And your knee socks

2157,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,"""Up rolled the riot van. And sparked excitement in the boys. But the policemen look annoyed. Perhaps these are ones they should avoid. They got a chase last night from men. With truncheon's dressed in hats. They didn't do that much wrong. Still ran away though for the laugh. """"Please just stop talking. Because they won't find us if you do. Oh those silly boys in blue. Well they won't catch me and you"""". """"Have you been drinking son. You don't look old enough to me"""". """"I'm sorry officer. Is there a certain age you're supposed to be?. Nobody told me"""". Up rolled the riot van. And these lads just wind the coppers up. Ask why they don't catch proper crooks. Get their address and their name's took. But they couldn't care less. He got thrown in the riot van. And all the coppers kicked him in. And there was no way he could win. Just had to take it on the chin"""
2158,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,Religious iconography giving you the creeps?. I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek. The rise of the machines. I must admit you gave me something momentarily. In which I could believe. But the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved. And it's on its way back to scoop you up. Not on my watch. I want to stay with you my love. The way that some science fiction does reflections in. The silver screen of strange societies. Swamp monster with a hard on for connectivity. The ascension of the cream. Mass panic on a not too distant future colony. Quantitative easing. I want to make a simple point about peace and love. But in a sexy way where it's not obvious. Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages. The way some science fiction does. I've got the world on a wire. in my little mirror mirror on the wall. In the pocket of my raincoat. So I tried to write a song to make you blush. But I've a feeling that the whole thing. May well just end up too clever for its own good. The way some science fiction does
2159,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,Sketchead. He's coming to your party. He's walking up your drive. And he's swinging all his keys round. Sketchead. He's seen you with ya top off. He already know's your boyfriend. Retain your introduction. Sketchead. There comes the protagonist. The pips in your quince. The hour behind the spiral. The itch you can't itch in your ear. And the knot that shattered your packet of peppermints. Sketchead. There's poison in his spit. He'll complement your tits. And leave you to your wits. Sketchead. Convincingly insisting the tyres were bald. When you gave him the car. Sketchead. Still coming to your party. Still walking up your drive. And he's swinging all his keys round on his finger. As a pendulum to unnerve. And then there's you. You've changed. I approached you like you were the same. But soon it was apparent a new name was required. Your lips went on fire. Accomplishments that mean while I. Captivated by your magazine skin. The tint on your limbs. That obscures to begin. And you know full well. That anyone who says that they don't prefer the sequel. Will still be swinging on themselves tonight
2160,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,Pussyfooting. Setting sun. Make a wish that weighs a ton. There are no handles for you to hold. No understanding where it goes. Jealousy. In technicolor. Fear by name. Love by numbers. Streetlight amber. Wanderlust. Clouded rainbow. Blunderbuss. She looks as if she’s blowing a kiss at me. And suddenly the sky is a scissor. Sitting on the floor with a tambourine. Crushing up a bundle of love. Don’t take it so personally. You’re not the only one. That time has got it in for Honey. That’s where you’re wrong. All the old flames. Fastened on. Make a wish that weighs a ton. There are no handles you can hold. No understanding where it goes. She looks as if she’s blowing a kiss at me. And suddenly the sky is a scissor.

2161,Arctic Monkeys,Rock,I wish you would have smiled in the bakery. Or sat on a tatty seatee. At a mutual friends gathering. And the more you keep on looking. The more it's hard to take. Love we're in stalemate. To never meet is surely where we're bound. There's one in every town. Just there to grind you down. I wish I would have seen you in the post office. Well maybe I did and I missed it. Too busy with the mind on clever lines. Why not the rounders pitch or the canteen. You're slacking love were have you been. Just have to go and wait until tonight. So give me the invite. Don't worry it's alright. I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade. Sippin' on a lemonade. In the paper cup and chewin on a straw. And I wish I would have seen you in the bakery. But if i'd seen you in the bakery. You probably wouldn't have seen me

2164,Audioslave,Rock,On a cobweb afternoon. In a room full of emptiness. By a freeway I confess. I was lost in the pages. Of a book full of death. Reading how we'll die alone. And if we're good we'll lay to rest. Anywhere we want to go. In your house I long to be. Room by room patiently. I'll wait for you there. Like a stone I'll wait for you there. Alone. And on my deathbed I will pray. To the gods and the angels. Like a pagan to anyone. Who will take me to heaven. To a place I recall. I was there so long ago. The sky was bruised. The wine was bled. And there you led me on. In your house I long to be. Room by room patiently. I'll wait for you there. Like a stone I'll wait for you there. Alone alone. And on I read. Until the day was gone. And I sat in regret. Of all the things I've done. For all that I've blessed. And all that I've wronged. In dreams until my death. I will wander on. In your house I long to be. Room by room patiently. I'll wait for you there. Like a stone I'll wait for you there. Alone alone

I am not your rolling wheels. I am the highway. I am not your carpet ride. I am the sky. Friends and liars. Don't wait for me. Cause I'll get on. All by myself. I'll put millions of miles. Under my heels. And still too close to you. I feel. I am not your rolling wheels. I am the highway. I am not your carpet ride. I am the sky. I am not your blowing wind. I am the lightining. I am not your autumn moon. I am the night
2166,Audioslave,Rock,I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. With a graveyard tan carrying a cross. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like studying faces in a parking lot. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like driving backwards in the fog. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. Chorus. The things that I've loved the things that I've lost. The things I've held sacred that I've dropped. I won't lie no more you can bet. I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget. I like gypsy moths and radio talk. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like gospel music and canned applause. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like colorful clothing in the sun. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. Chorus. The things that I've loved the things that I've lost.

2167,Audioslave,Rock,Once upon a time I was of the mind. To lay your burden down. And leave you where you stood. And you believed I could. You'd seen it done before. I could read your thoughts. Tell you what you saw. And never say a word. Now all that is gone. Overwith and done - never to return. I can tell you why. People die alone. I can tell you I'm. A shadow on the sun. Staring at the loss. Looking for a cause. And never really sure. Nothing but a hole. To live without a soul. And nothing to be learned. I can tell you why. People go insane. I can show you how. You could do the same. I can tell you why. The end will never come. I can tell you I'm. A shadow on the sun. Shapes of every size. Move behind my eyes. Doors inside my head. Bolted from within. Every drop of flame. Lights a candle in. Memory of the one. Who lives inside my skin. I can tell you why. People go insane. I can show you how. You could do the same. I can tell you why. The end will never come. I can tell you I'm. A shadow on the sun

2169,Audioslave,Rock,Settle down now and sit with me. Let me tell you how this all came to be. A yellow flower with your pedals to the air. And flying on paper wings that brought you here. Summer rolls on in the lazy hours. An ether dream way. Of hummingbirds and clouds. Midnight swims in the cool black waves. And you in my arms as it rolls away. Chorus. Little dandelion. Let your heart keep time. Now the clouds are gone. All of your tomorrows shine. Oh oh. All of your tomorrows shine. Oh oh. All of your tomorrows shine. Born of restless night the moon as a pearl.

2171,Audioslave,Rock,Roll me on your frozen fields. Break my bones to watch them heal. Drown me in your thirsty veins. Where I'll watch and I'll wait. And pray for the rain. Curl like smoke and breathe again. Down your throat inside your ribs. Through your spine in every nerve. Where I watch and I wait and yield to the hurt. And if you don't believe. The sun will rise. Stand alone and greet. The coming night. In the last remaining light. Seven moons and seven suns. Heaven waits for those who run. Down your winter and. Underneath your waves.

2172,Audioslave,Rock,Beauty is what the eyes behold. And you burn brighter than most. I chased you thru the midnight streets. To be where I could speak freely. I didn't care what tomorrow held. I felt the world turning only for us. Only bliss now for you and me. Rise up let life's kiss send us reeling. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets and no remorse. We have more than everything. More than man or machine. More than luck. More than fiction. Higher than any religion. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets and no remorse. We'll squeeze the blood out of life. And say goodnight to the silver of old. Even when wrong we're right. Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold. I've come to realize. Where happiness lies. I want you to know I know. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets no remorse

2176,Audioslave,Rock,I met a man locked away. For things he hadn't done. Innocence on a ball and chain. He'll never feel the sun. Again on his face or roses. In his hands but when he smiled. At me I could understand. If your're free you'll never see the walls. If your head is clear you'll never free fall. If you're right you'll never fear the wrong. Id your head is high you'll never fear at all. There was a daughter of a man. Who took his life too young. She swore she'd never do the same. Then did just what he'd done. And a boy who's gone insane. Voices in his head. No one knows what they say. Now his mother's dead. If your're free you'll never see the walls. If your head is clear you'll never free fall. If you're right you'll never fear the wrong. Id your head is high you'll never fear at all. There was a man who had a face. The looked a lot like me. I saw him in the mirror and. I fought him in the street. And when he turned away I shot him in the head. Then I came to realize. I had killed myself. If your're free you'll never see the walls. If your head is clear you'll never free fall. If you're right you'll never fear the wrong. Id your head is high you'll never fear at all
2177,Audioslave,Rock,Pearls and swine bereft of me. Long and weary my road has been. I was lost in the cities. Alone in the hills. No sorrow or pity. For the leaving. I feel. I am not your rolling wheels. I am the highway. I am not your carpet ride. I am the sky. Friends and liars. Don't wait for me. Cause I'll get on. All by myself. I'll put millions of miles. Under my heels. And still too close to you. I feel. I am not your rolling wheels. I am the highway. I am not your carpet ride. I am the sky. I am not your blowing wind. I am the lightining. I am not your autumn moon. I am the night
2178,Audioslave,Rock,In my hour of need. On a sea of gray. On my knees I pray to you. Help me find the bones of the dying dead. Won't you light my way. Won't you light my way. A bullet is a man. From time to time he strays. I compare my life to this. To this I relate. And I'm willing. To listen to your answers. And I'm not afraid. To tell you I need you today. Won't you light my way. Won't you light my way. So when I'm lost. Or I'm tired and deprayed. Or when my high bullet mind. Goes astray won't you light my way. Don't save it for another day
2179,Audioslave,Rock,On a cobweb afternoon. In a room full of emptiness. By a freeway I confess. I was lost in the pages. Of a book full of death. Reading how we'll die alone. And if we're good we'll lay to rest. Anywhere we want to go. In your house I long to be. Room by room patiently. I'll wait for you there. Like a stone I'll wait for you there. Alone. And on my deathbed I will pray. To the gods and the angels. Like a pagan to anyone. Who will take me to heaven. To a place I recall. I was there so long ago. The sky was bruised. The wine was bled. And there you led me on. In your house I long to be. Room by room patiently. I'll wait for you there. Like a stone I'll wait for you there. Alone alone. And on I read. Until the day was gone. And I sat in regret. Of all the things I've done. For all that I've blessed. And all that I've wronged. In dreams until my death. I will wander on. In your house I long to be. Room by room patiently. I'll wait for you there. Like a stone I'll wait for you there. Alone alone
2180,Audioslave,Rock,Well they don't hate you. You know they love you. But they gonna come kill you. They dont mean you any harm. It's just what they do. Could be your mother. Could be your father. Or your best friend in the world. But just like. Blood and rain. Like love and pain. Are one and the same. Just like. Blood and rain. Like love and pain. Are one and the same. Yeah yeah yeah.

But just like. Blood and rain. Love and pain. Are one and the same. (solo). Just like. Blood and rain. Love and pain. Are one and the same
2181,Audioslave,Rock,Once upon a time I was of the mind. To lay your burden down. And leave you where you stood. And you believed I could. You'd seen it done before. I could read your thoughts. Tell you what you saw. And never say a word. Now all that is gone. Overwith and done - never to return. I can tell you why. People die alone. I can tell you I'm. A shadow on the sun. Staring at the loss. Looking for a cause. And never really sure. Nothing but a hole. To live without a soul. And nothing to be learned. I can tell you why. People go insane. I can show you how. You could do the same. I can tell you why. The end will never come. I can tell you I'm. A shadow on the sun. Shapes of every size. Move behind my eyes. Doors inside my head. Bolted from within. Every drop of flame. Lights a candle in. Memory of the one. Who lives inside my skin. I can tell you why. People go insane. I can show you how. You could do the same. I can tell you why. The end will never come. I can tell you I'm. A shadow on the sun
2182,Audioslave,Rock,In the here and now I wait. Among the young and the old. Between the moon and the ground I play. With my children in my home. This is for the daughters and sons. Of forgotten ones. Learning how to stand. This is for the innocent unknowns. Buried in the sand. Running from the sound of a gun. And you’re weary. Running from the sound of a gun. In the crack of the blackness I wake. It’s getting closer every night. My city playground is a battleground. Between the wrong and the right. I could run free as a child. I was safe and wild. Naked and unarmed. Now I’m grown and safe in my home. But some will never stop. Running from the sound of a gun. Til’ you’re weary. Running from the sound of a gun. The open mouth of the city. Swallowed the town. With that same old concrete. That I still walk down. And it seems they put a shine. On this place when I was young. But baby I just don’t see it now. Running from the sound of a gun. Til’ I’m weary. Running from the sound of a gun

2184,Audioslave,Rock,Roll me on your frozen fields. Break my bones to watch them heal. Drown me in your thirsty veins. Where I'll watch and I'll wait. And pray for the rain. Curl like smoke and breathe again. Down your throat inside your ribs. Through your spine in every nerve. Where I watch and I wait and yield to the hurt. And if you don't believe. The sun will rise. Stand alone and greet. The coming night. In the last remaining light. Seven moons and seven suns. Heaven waits for those who run. Down your winter and. Underneath your waves. Where you watch and you wait. And pray for the day. And if you don't believe. The sun will rise. Stand alone and greet. The coming night. In the last remaining light

2187,Audioslave,Rock,Beauty is what the eyes behold. And you burn brighter than most. I chased you thru the midnight streets. To be where I could speak freely. I didn't care what tomorrow held. I felt the world turning only for us. Only bliss now for you and me. Rise up let life's kiss send us reeling. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets and no remorse. We have more than everything. More than man or machine. More than luck. More than fiction. Higher than any religion. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets and no remorse. We'll squeeze the blood out of life. And say goodnight to the silver of old. Even when wrong we're right. Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold. I've come to realize. Where happiness lies. I want you to know I know. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets no remorse
2188,Audrye Sessions,Rock,I catch every whisper. Surrounding your head. You got the look. of a poor girl wondering. Where she will sleep tonight. Am I a fool to let you in.

Sometime were blind and stupid. Sometimes we need to find out for ourselves. We all get carried away. Sally never had a night like this. Now shes dangling one foot off a cliff. Saying bet I could beat you down. Shes crouched behind her bedroom door. Making phone calls that her friends ignore. Wondering why the world let her down. And am I a fool to let you..

2190,Avril Lavigne,Rock,I always needed time on my own. I never thought I'd need you there when I cry. And the days feel like years when I'm alone. And the bed where you lie. Is made up on your side. When you walk away I count the steps that you take. Do you see how much I need you right now?. When you're gone. The pieces of my heart are missing you. When you're gone. The face I came to know is missing too. When you're gone. The words I need to hear to always get me through the day. And make it ok. I miss you. I've never felt this way before. Everything that I do.

2204,Avril Lavigne,Rock,I've gotta keep the calm before the storm. I don't want less. I don't want more. Must bar the windows and the doors. To keep me safe to keep me warm. Yeah my life is what I'm fighting for. Can't part the sea. Can't reach the shore. And my voice becomes the driving force. I won't let this pull me overboard. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. So pull me up from down below. ‘Cause I'm underneath the undertow. Come dry me off and hold me close. I need you now I need you most. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Keep my head above water above water. And I can't see in the stormy weather. I can't seem to keep it all together. And I can't swim the ocean like this forever. And I can't breathe. God keep my head above water. I lose my breath at the bottom. Come rescue me. I'll be waiting. I'm too young to fall asleep. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Keep my head above water above water

2206,Avril Lavigne,Rock,And I'd give up forever to touch you. 'Cause I know that I feel you somehow. You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be. And I don't want to go home right now. And all I can taste is this moment. And all I can breathe is your life. 'Cause sooner or later it's over. I just don't want to miss you tonight. And I don't want the world to see me. 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken. I just want you to know who I am. And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming. Or the moment of truth in your lies. When everything feels like the movies. Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive. 'Cause I don't want the world to see me. 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken. I just want you to know who I am. (break and solo). And I don't want the world to see me. 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken. I just want you to know who I am. And I don't want the world to see me. 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand.

What a big surprise. But I'm not lost. I'm not gone. I haven't forgot. These feelings I can't shake no more. These feelings are running out the door. I can feel it falling down. And I'm not coming back around. These feelings I can't take no more. This emptiness in the bottom drawer. It's getting harder to pretend. And I'm not coming back around again. Remember when.... I remember when. It was together 'til the end. Now I'm alone again. Where do I begin?. I cried a little bit. You died a little bit. Please say there's no regrets. And say you won't forget.

I'm not coming back. I can't pretend. Remember When. These feelings I can't shake no more. These feelings are running out the door. I can feel it falling down. And I'm not coming back around.

I'm living a lie. When I'm alone I. Feel so much better. And when I'm around you. I don't feel. Together. It doesn't feel right at all. Together. Together we built a wall. Together.

2213,Avril Lavigne,Rock,I always needed time on my own. I never thought I'd need you there when I cry. And the days feel like years when I'm alone. And the bed where you lie. Is made up on your side. When you walk away I count the steps that you take. Do you see how much I need you right now?. When you're gone. The pieces of my heart are missing you. When you're gone. The face I came to know is missing too. When you're gone. The words I need to hear to always get me through the day. And make it ok. I miss you. I've never felt this way before. Everything that I do.

Do you see how much I need you right now?. When you're gone. The pieces of my heart are missing you. When you're gone. The face I came to know is missing too. When you're gone. The words I need to hear to always get me through the day. And make it ok. I miss you. We were made for each other. I'll keep forever. I know we were. Yeah yeah !. All I ever wanted was for you to know. Everything I do I give my heart and soul. I can hardly breathe. I need to feel you here with me. yeah. When you're gone. The pieces of my heart are missing you.

2215,Bad Religion,Rock,i was born on planet earth. the rotating ball whre man comes first. it's been around for a long time. but now its time to watch it die. i saw a man on my big blue screen. he ruled the world economy. he said the rich would never concede. but some day soon he'll be put to sleep. i've seen the life of the forest green. and adaptations of the deep blue sea. and who knows who is the fittest. they will all soon be put to rest. on a plunging flight and we're sitting. in the pilots seat in the midst of life. people on a dark horizon praying. somebody will save their lives. i was born on the planet earth. at a drastic time full of plastic mirth. and every day i've seen increasing signs. and you would too if you'd opened your eyes. you had a chance you did not try. so now it's time to watch it die.
2216,Bad Religion,Rock,"""Hey brother christian with your high and mighty errand. Your actions speak so loud I can't hear a word your saying. Hey sister bleeding heart with all of your compassion. Your labors soothe the hort but can't assuage temptation. Hey man of science with your perfect rules of measure. Can you improve the place with the data that you gather?. Hey mother mercy can your loins bear fruit forever. Is your fecundity a trammel or a treasure?. I want to conquer the world. Give all the idiots a brand new religion. Put an end to poverty uncleanliness and toil. Promote equality in all of my decisions. With a quick wink of an eye and a """"God you must be joking"""". Hey mister diplomat with your worldly aspirations. Did you see your children cry when you left them at the station?. Hey moral soldier you've got righteous proclamations. And precious tomes to fuel your pulpy conflagrations. Chorus. Is there a man that can conquer that which can't be tamed?. And if that mad could speak would the words evoked be sane?. Ask me the reasons for misery and shame. I'll give your reasons for the wind and rain. Chorus. I want to conquer the world. Expose the culprits and feed teh to the children. I'll do away with pollution and then I'll save the whales. We'll have peace on earth and global communion. I want to conquer the world."""
2217,Bad Religion,Rock,Stop them from shimmering away. On blank sidewalk glittering asphalt somewhere summer days. The wrong way kids were something more than friends. Navigating a sprawl without end. Did you ever want to take bad advice. Did you ever want to go and take it twice. Do you remember when the world began to put up its thorny fence. Right you are my friend. So what’s wrong with them. There go the wrong way kids. Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. And they call them the wrong way kids. The kids today are gone away petitioning the dust. With nobody to look up to because they're looking up to us. Just misfit melancholy dregs gone lost in the mall. Wanderers to nowhere at all. Did you ever want to take bad advice. Did you ever want to go and take it twice. Do you remember when the world began to put up its thorny fence. Right you are my friend. So what’s wrong with them. There go the wrong way kids. Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. And they call them the wrong way kids
2218,Bad Religion,Rock,Hey scientist please save us from our rainy days. Because your counterpart in the magic art. Is manufacturing judgment day. There's a fell wind blowing out of the east. Bringing famine drought and plague. Well now at least that's what they say. Rain fell like judgment. Across my windowpane. Said it fell like judgment. But it was only rain. Well I know what's wrong and I know what's right. And I know that evil exists sure as day turns into night. When a man gets down on his knees to pray. You know he'll find what he is able. But chances are he'll find it either way. Rain fell like judgment. Across my windowpane. Said it fell like judgment. But it was only rain. Oh lord have mercy on a humble man. Lost in the wilderness without a guiding hand. Rain fell like judgment. Across my windowpane. Said it fell like judgment. But it was only rain. Rain fell like judgment. Across my windowpane. Said it fell like judgment. But it was only rain
2219,Bad Religion,Rock,know I'm part of something greater than myself. Don't know the meaning of it but I hope that matters less. I don't know anything when I'm factored out of scale. I know I'm part of something greater than myself. We're all engaging in a game of attrition. Maybe god is just a chemical fiction. I'm a monkey with a madding affliction. With fact checking for a mental condition. I know I'm part of something greater than myself. Don't know the meaning of it but I hope that matters less. I don't know anything when I'm factored out of scale. I know I'm part of something greater than myself
2220,Bad Religion,Rock,England seemed like such a beautiful place from afar. Until one day I went and saw how miserabely how things really are. All Fantastic Images they only are apparent. Propagated just by hope and desire to share it. Beauty was the allure that brought me close to you. Loneliness was the bond that made me stick like glue. All Fantastic Images they only are apparent. Promoted by desperate hope that things are somewhere better. I don't have a thing against fantasy. But to chase it down just don't make sense to me. If you're only hope is simply peace and love. You end up discarding most of what you're made of. All Fantastic Images they only are apparent. Promoted by desperate hope. And the need to share it
2221,Bad Religion,Rock,Everybody wants to dance in a playpen. But nobody wants to play in my garden. I see the hippies on an angry line. Guess they don't get my meaning. I'm enchanted by the birds in my blossoms. I'm enamored by young lovers on the weekend. I like the Fourth of July. When bombs start flashing. And I wish I had a shiny red top. A bugle with a big brass bell would cheer me up. Or maybe something bigger that could really go pop!. So I could make the gardening stop. Come out to play. Come out to play. And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day. In my atomic garden. All my scientists are working on a deadline. So my psychologist is working day and night time. They say they know what's best for me. But they don't know what they're doing. And I'm glad I'm not Gorbachev. 'Cause I'd wiggle all night. Like jelly in a pot. At least he's got a garden with a fertile plot. And a party that will never stop. Come out to play. Come out to play. And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day. In my atomic .... I hope there's nothing wrong out there. I'm watching from my room inside my room. Come out to play. Come out to play. And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day. In my atomic ... garden!
2222,Bad Religion,Rock,It could happen to you. A defect from the wasted outskirts of los angeles. With a crumpled-up pass for the rtd. And no authority or trajectory. On the brink of insanity. You'd better believe it. Because it's written all over your face. Just a neighborhood reject. Out of step and out of place. You'd better believe it. Would you ever have thought. Persistence could prevail. Against the almost. Unbearable weight of the system?. With nothing better to do. And no one else who you can look up to. You'd better believe it. Because it's written all over your face. A political defect. Out of step and out of place. You'd better believe it. And the future is bright. When ideas run astray. So turn out the light. A punk can't have a say. Sometimes desire is all that's there
2223,Bad Religion,Rock,With nothing better to do. no one. To come on to. I woefully conclude to take it out on you. I'm bored to the extreme this world. Of foolish dreams desillusion. I am not who I seem to be (yeah). Sure I might do harm and bear my right to arm RETRIBUTION. If only someone would listen to me. To me a room and empty shelf a book. On mental health I look for inner wealth by punishing myself. I'm bored to the extreme this world. Of foolish dreams desillusion. I am not who I seem to be (yeah). Sure I might do harm and bear my right to arm RETRIBUTION. If only someone would listen to me
2224,Bad Religion,Rock,Every day's the same routine. Of endless chores and boring details. And you know you're waiting. For the perfect condition for your ship to set sail. But of course the climate's always changing. Clining to the past has got you straining. Comes the recognition now you're on a mission. That is born to fail. (leave it!). Brothers say goodbye. Sisters don't you cry. All embrace the times. Wade into the changing tide. Searching for philosophy of life can be a drag on the soul. Nowadays we pick and choose the pieces. From other people's wisdom of old. But of course the climate's always changing. Clinging to the past has got you straining. Realizing all your most cherished beliefs. Are subject to rot and mold. (come on!). Brothers say goodbye. Sisters don't you cry. All embrace the times. Wade into the changing tide
2225,Bad Religion,Rock,These rational delusions have got to cease. The second hand has finally got the best of me. I'm too aware about the singularity. That brought me to the edge of time. And it's always on my mind now. They say what has passed is coming back some day. The world is turning faster but it's just one way. And I'm desperate to try most anything to breed. A simple Chronophobia. A simple Chronophobia now. A simple Chronophobia. A simple Chronophobia now. Maybe there's a science or technology. To help me come to terms with my maker. Since natural selection never banked on me. I must be an exception to the plan. Someone help me understand now. Cryogenic methods are intractable. And collagen polymers aren't so terrible. But they still can't prevent. the inevitable farewell. A simple Chronophobia. A simple Chronophobia now. A simple Chronophobia. A simple Chronophobia now
2226,Bad Religion,Rock,Well let me bend your ear. Because I'm never really there. When shadows turns to light. And hope into despair. There was an only one. But the broody skies above. Brought down a shameful stain. And not a single drop of cleaning rain. Let me say. (Oh oh) well there's no place left to hide. (Oh oh) from the loneliness inside. The road to you is paved right through with bloody good intentions. And missin' you is like kissin'. Cyanide. Well in this world of things. One of them is lost. I've been it in my dreams. But not without a cost. Down a lonely street. It was our destiny to meet. Nobody asked you twice. We found purchase then with no requite (nothing nice). (Oh oh) well there's no place left to hide. (Oh oh) from the loneliness inside. The road to you is paved right through with bloody good intentions. And missin' you is like kissin'. Cyanide. Would you believe in something good that's so wrong. And have you worshiped our invention. I've paid my debt in coin and sweat with trifling hesitation. Because the road to you is paved with good intentions. (Oh oh) well there's no place left to hide. (Oh oh) from the loneliness inside. The road to you is paved right through with bloody good intentions. And missin' you is like kissin'. Cyanide. Cyanide. Cyanide. Cyanide. Cyanide. Cyanide. Cyanide. Cyanide
2227,Bad Religion,Rock,Welcome my son to where the work is never done. And the hungry are seldom ever fed. The department of false hope. Is a proving ground for dopes. And they'll grind your tiny bones. To make their bread (hosanna). So hold your head up high forgotten man. Tomorrow won't be made for you. And everybody's gotta try to lend a helping hand. For god and man there's nothing more to do. It crackled on the radio. Through bright plumes of the sun. The announcer said the age of faith was dead. Though the adolescent nation. Was just looking for salvation. The beast of reason reared it's ugly head (hosanna). So hold your head up high forgotten man. Tomorrow's not for me and you. And everybody's gotta try to lend a helping hand. For god and man there's nothing more to do. From your cradle of destruction. With the poorest of instruction. And the merest sliver of a tune. You managed somehow to muddle through. So hold your head up high forgotten man. Tomorrow's not for me and you. And everybody's gotta try to lend a helping hand. For god and man there's nothing more to do
2228,Bad Religion,Rock,Who do you believe can put some meaning in your life. meaning in your life. meaning in your life. Who do you conceive to provide you guidance and light. guidance and light. guidance and light. Are they waiting for you in the by and by. Do you even have to try. Headed for eternity and destined for nothing. The future isn't difficult to see. It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions. Lament not your vanquished fantasy. It's only destiny. Why do you consent to live in ignorance and fear. ignorance and fear. ignorance and fear. Ancient people succumbed to it can it happen here. can it happen here. can it happen here. Does it make you suffer cuz you have to die. Is it best to live a lie. Headed for eternity and destined for nothing. The future isn't difficult to see. It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions. Lament not your vanquished fantasy. It's only destiny. Why can't you see. there ain't no destiny. for you and me. there ain't no destiny. Why can't you see. there ain't no destiny. for you and me. there ain't no destiny. Headed for eternity and destined for nothing. The future isn't difficult to see. It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions. Lament not your vanquished fantasy. It's only destiny
2229,Bad Religion,Rock,Wasted days and cigarettes. Cracked cement and palms. Bodhidharma has gone fission. With your vedic mom. Yeah the sergeant major is dreamin' of genie. And she's armed with a borrowed polka dot bikini. Oh yeah tomorrow's coming down like dharma and the bomb. Falling down. Falling down. Like dharma and the bomb. Falling down. Falling down. Like dharma and the bomb. The shallows seem evangelical. When you're slammed up against a wall. And your stoked to watch all creation go over the falls. Yeah kali is coming and you'd better believe it. That girl's got the atom and the bhagavad ghita. Oh yeah samsara's coming down like dharma and the bomb. Falling down. Falling down like. Like dharma and the bomb. Falling down. Falling down like. Like dharma and the bomb
2230,Bad Religion,Rock,I had a dream...of unity. Where we would walk side by side. But today I see that it's only me. Just trying to get by. Sometimes we strive...undetoured. to walk as one toward our goals. But as people stray towards more selfish ways. we see we have no control ... no control
2231,Bad Religion,Rock,In the garden where he was cast out by the lord. Flames an Omni-directional sword. For he as ever failed to gather up the fruit. And thus was banished with his loot. He cantered aimlessly through endless. Permutations of night. Seeking a purpose and the meaning of kin. And when it finally came to him. You could've mistook it for the meaning of sin. The women wish him well. Every time he cast off marching to hell. Now if you've never seen a terrible sight. Stroll the garden of earthly delight. Maybe we can make it right – someday I'll see. You. High above the Fields of Mars. He knelt down before the unholy mob – who. Cried was is god. Gleaming outwardly with great pride – and. Prepared to die. The women wish him well. Every time he cast off marching to hell. Now if you've never seen a terrible sight. Stroll the garden of earthly delight. Maybe we can make it right – someday I'll see. You. High above the Fields of Mars. Who cannot fight anymore. Will never love any less. That kid inside of murder. Must be committed. To live a life of hostility. Never asking what it means. When mother nation. Blood and religion. Sanction killing – upon the fields of mars. High above the Fields of Mars
2232,Bad Religion,Rock,I can't stop the way i feel. But i can penetrate your religion with a nail. You are mine and we are twine. When we radiate in waves together everything is fine. Hello cruel world do you know that you're killing me?. I don't mind but i could use a little sympathy. I've been blind as a fool can be. My dear cruel world do you ever think about me?. I can feel so alone with you right here. And yet i turn to you for comfort in my despair. You are dust and i am bone. And i will love your endless gaze of madness until i turn to stone. Hello cruel world do you know that you're killing me?. I don't mind but i could use a little sympathy. I've been blind as a fool can be. My dear cruel world now i know you are my everything. Please forgive me. Hello cruel world do you know that you're killing me. I don't mind but i could use a little sympathy. I've been blind as only a man can be. My dear cruel world now i've made a mess of everything
2233,Bad Religion,Rock,stranded. in a life in which your struggle for acceptance. is a never-ending chore. upbraided. for your actions past and present and rewarded for ideas. of the future's bright open door. the henchman. is the human analogue of the suffering multitudes. who like good dogs sit and lick for their reward. so what good advice have I got for you. to insure against your likely metamorphosis into this reprobate?. don't be a henchman!. stand on your laurels. do what no one else does. praise the good of other men for good man's sake. and when everyone else in the world follows your lead.

You know I did. (Did you cry?) I couldn’t get it right. (Did you live?) Always on the edge. (Did you lie?) Causing such a fright. (Did you love?) Oh to be forgiven. (Did you try?) But it wouldn’t be right. God it feels like an honest goodbye. Whoa ho ooh whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa -.

2235,Bad Religion,Rock,going through a world of sad debris. regard quixotic reveries of ownership. the blossoming disease of man called tenure and accretion. the ancient western treadmill of deception and derision. but I want something more. racing through a life of tragic wastage. I experience the loss of trust and innocence. the billowing cyclone of time has blown away our reasons. as we trudge like blind men forward trying to avoid collision. but I want something more.

Hey mother mercy can your loins bear fruit forever. Is your fecundity a trammel or a treasure?. I want to conquer the world. Give all the idiots a brand new religion.

2237,Bad Religion,Rock,There's something pathetic in the world today. And i don't know how it all began. As if all the shame and punishment will finally make me understand. A word means nothing wanting action. Intentions are valuable as deeds. And a wound can dog you for a lifetime. Unless it only makes you bleed. Everybody knows what's in their heart is right. I'm just a termite on an ant hill. I think about it every single day. A senseless being lacking inspiration. Just waiting to be blown away. Everybody knows what's in their heart is right
2238,Bad Religion,Rock,you never know that feeling till you try. that healing feeling can turn you all about. and you can see the second wave of life. that losers triangle sets you down and out. don't misread. don't mislead. you could be your only friend. but when the hammer comes down. and you don't hear a sound. you can look all around and see....

Exposure is a pitiful. And pointless way of dying. Before it gets me. I'll set a funeral pyre. Kerosene keeps me warm. I'm alone to watch it burn. Kerosene. I'm a man and. My dignity won't wave. Tonight buildings rage!. Kerosene keeps me warm. It feels so good. To watch it burn kerosene. Kerosene keeps me warm. Feels so good. To watch it burn kerosene
2240,Bad Religion,Rock,I've spent my life observing. and then pondering this place. and never has confusion ever ceased. I've also heard a lot of exaltation for our kind. and sanctimonious reverence for peace. The stories from our childhood. condition us to think. that beauty is a basic human trait. but how are they reconciled with daily realities. like poverty and dominance and rape. But you have to be. stone cold dead not to see. overwhelming incongruity. as we search for suggestions to remedy.... ...Mediocrity. If you just sit back and record what you see. the tragic and exquisite are the same to some degree. but most events depict a common theme:. there's far more disorder. than there is harmony. I said you've got to be. stone cold dead not to see. overwhelming incongruity. It is pointless to search for teleology. Mediocrity. (always mediocrity).
2241,Bad Religion,Rock,take those potatoes out of your ear. listen to the warnings. verify all your fears. there's a world outside. that's ready to blow. and we're all to blame. when it finally explodes. you gotta listen up. gotta listen to what. they're telling you. gotta listen up and think. about what they're saying to you. they're the modern day catastrophists. they've got practical solutions. (know all the right equations). they're the self-appointed. righteous pragmatists. and they know 50 ways. to save the world. what makes you think. you can cure our disease?. maybe its just our biology. maybe its time to make room. for another species. this is the 21st Century.

Bad ape you made a mistake. Annihilation in a cannibal – war. Well cultivation might have served you. Might have raised you up unscathed. If you had called that fucker by its name. Did you listen to the arbiter's beck and call?. Did you find what you were looking for or not at all?. NOT AL ALL. Ape shall not murder – ape wasn't so sure. Bad ape you made a mistake. Annihilation in a cannibal – war. Culture might have cured you. And raised you up unscathed. If you had called that fucker by its name. Say the name. Say the name. Say the name
2243,Bad Religion,Rock,My head is full of ghosts. But i'm no revenant. Despite my resident's rivalry. And i'll be the faithful pilot. On our blind trajectory. Do you want to know a secret. Will you hold it close and dear. This will not be made apparent. But you and i are not alone in here. My head is full of ghosts. No apparition. A partition from the host. A temple of cognition. And forbidden to approach. Oh to hell with superstition. There's a stranger in the house. I don't need no exorcism. I need a key. And the lock is inside out. Now meta-cognition is just intuition. And dreamers we'll bark at the moon. The weaver's unknown by the loom. My head is full of ghosts. And i'm the pilot. Of ultra-violent ancestry. And i'll destroy these passers-by. With zest and artistry. Ghost!. Part apparition. A partition from the host. A temple of the hidden. And unbidden to approach
2244,Bad Religion,Rock,When the world has gone mad and there's nowhere to roam. The lights are all on but nobody's home. There comes a time when you look up to the sky. And ask why do my favorite songs always make me cry. And am I losing my sanity. My sanity I've nothing to lose so please let me be. I've got a firm grip and strong roots like a tree burrowed deep in reality. I won't let you go What else can there be you're all I have. When you swore to be true our bed was belief. But alternative facts snuck in like a thief. There comes a time to release the cord of self. And with confidence declare your state of perfect mental health. Never doubting my sanity. My sanity I've nothing to lose so please let me be. My life is a song a short melody harmonizing with reality. I've got it real bad there's no remedy you're all I have. My dear sanity. Sometimes there's no sane reason for optimism. Oh my sanity my sanity I've nothing to lose so please let me be. My life is a song a short melody harmonizing with reality. I've got it real bad there's no remedy my world picture is exemplary. I won't let you go what else can there be you're all I have. My dear sanity

2247,Bad Religion,Rock,Hey scientist please save us from our rainy days. Because your counterpart in the magic art. Is manufacturing judgment day. There's a fell wind blowing out of the east. Bringing famine drought and plague. Well now at least that's what they say. Rain fell like judgment. Across my windowpane. Said it fell like judgment. But it was only rain. Well I know what's wrong and I know what's right. And I know that evil exists sure as day turns into night. When a man gets down on his knees to pray. You know he'll find what he is able. But chances are he'll find it either way. Rain fell like judgment. Across my windowpane. Said it fell like judgment. But it was only rain. Oh lord have mercy on a humble man. Lost in the wilderness without a guiding hand. Rain fell like judgment. Across my windowpane. Said it fell like judgment. But it was only rain. Rain fell like judgment. Across my windowpane. Said it fell like judgment. But it was only rain
2248,Bad Religion,Rock,Instrumental
2249,Bad Religion,Rock,Some people are almost impossible to live with. Some people have faith in the craziest things. They follow outdated conventions that were recorded. But most of it to me all sounds insane. Maybe that's what you need to get you through the night. Maybe you've seen the light. But you know that popular consensus doesn't make it right. Nothing can go on while forever increasing. The universe expanding is a different thing. But to turn a nasty habit into a virtue. Can't replace the need for charity. Maybe it's what you need to help you through the night. Maybe you've seen the light. But you know popular consensus doesn't make it right. Like the seed of all creation or a doomsday scheme. The future might be bright or bleak. But you know popular consensus doesn't mean much to me
2250,Bad Religion,Rock,Nothing more. Nothing less. An icon on the wall. Decoration and duress. That which many. Strive to be. It's the marble statue. Starring over me. And nobody has the will to tear it down. It determines wrong and right. But to me it's just a stereotype. And it makes us lose our sight. The Portrait of Authority. Portrait of Authority. You tell me that's what I'm supposed to be. Portrait of Authority. You tell me that's what I'm supposed to be!. Another time. Another man. An oppressive intrusion. And a plague across his land. And it haunts. Him every day. It tells him he has no chance. His hopes just fade away. And he lives his life prepared to tear it down. But he can't muster the support. And to him it's just a stereotype. Of his life-long fight. The Portrait of Authority. Portrait of Authority. It embodies what he cannot be. Portrait of Authority. It's what he cannot be!. The Portrait of Authority!. Portrait of Authority. Portrait of Authority!
2251,Bad Religion,Rock,can't you feel it can't you see it. the promise of prosperity. it's overwhelming you and me. it afflicts us like a disease. ubiquitous compelling too. we cling to you like crazy glue. and inject such a potent seed. it's best for all humanity. the spread of culture. the sword of progress. the vector of suffrage. a warm and septic breeze. the pomp and elation. the duty and vocation. the blood of the hybrid. it's just a recipe. re-living our ancestry. the frightful lack of harmony. our fore-fothers who led the way. their victims are still here today. now it's time to erase the story. of our bogus fate. our history as it's portrayed. it's just a recipe for hate.

Some parties are just made that way. But when the bell rings. The boys will sing. Swing low sweet precariat. Let's say we try to get this right. Said the plutocrat to jesus christ. And when the old fox fearing the worst. Made his entrance in a hearse. Then the nine in black robes all went berserk. This is a tale of robin hood in reverse. Citizens united. I was excited. When the kids are united. they can never be divided. But that was yesterday. There's a brand new sham to today. Let's say we try to get this right. Said the plutocrat to jesus christ. And when the old fox fearing the worst. Made his entrance in a hearse. Then the nine in black robes all went berserk. This is a tale of robin hood in reverse
2253,Bad Religion,Rock,there's a watch in my pocket and its hands are broken. the face is blank but the gears are turning. confusion is a fundamental state of mind. it doesn't really matter what I'm figuring out. I'm guaranteed to wind up in a state of doubt. and sanity is a full-time job. in a world that is always changing. and sanity is a state of mind that you believe in. sanity. there's a shadow on the wall where the paint is peeling. my body's moving forward but my mind is reeling. depression is a fundamental state of being. it doesn't really matter how my day has turned out. I always end up living in this world of doubt.
2254,Bad Religion,Rock,Innocence burned. A line on the stake. Tortured and dumped. In nameless graves. Centuries wane. Authority died. Scattering seeds of ancient lies. Sinister rouge. Coming back for more. To even the score. Sinister rouge. Coming back for more. To even the score. Child molesters. And Jesuits. Holding secret conference. Underneath the pontiff’s nose. And only God will ever know. Sinister rouge. Coming back for more. To even the score. Sinister rouge. Coming back for more. To even the score. Give us this day. Our daily bread. And then you'll see. We'll not forget. Lick the wounds. Try on some lead. The modern world. Rejects your head. Sinister rouge. Coming back for more. To even the score. Sinister rouge. Coming back for more. To even the score. Sinister rouge. A nightmare comes to see you. Sinister rouge
2255,Bad Religion,Rock,Right now. Well it's finally time to face my fears. Gunna get the hell out of here. And create a fresher atmosphere. But the consequences clear. There's a furnace set on high. And a yearning undefined. But it's time to turn the tide. It's social suicide. Like you!. Perserverence is a useless tool. Just a patron on a ship of fools. Feigning interest in the cast and crew. While you've broken every single rule. There's a furnace set on high. And a yearning undefined. But it's time to turn the tide. It's social suicide. Shadows entertain the unwashed masses. Scholars explain their numb reactions. I don't even know if I can ever find truth. but I'm sure it won't come from following you. There's a furnace set on high. And a yearning undefined. But it's time to turn the tide. It's social suicide

Navigating a sprawl without end. Did you ever want to take bad advice. Did you ever want to go and take it twice. Do you remember when the world began to put up its thorny fence. Right you are my friend. So what’s wrong with them. There go the wrong way kids. Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh. And they call them the wrong way kids. The kids today are gone away petitioning the dust. With nobody to look up to because they're looking up to us. Just misfit melancholy dregs gone lost in the mall. Wanderers to nowhere at all. Did you ever want to take bad advice. Did you ever want to go and take it twice.

If there's a God up in the air. Someone looking over everyone. At least you've got something to fall back on. Deep in the heart of the country was a house I built from logs. A raven and a lady home. A quieted call through the day see the sun burn through fog. Approaching was a yellow dog. If there's a God up in the air. Someone looking over everyone. At least you've got something to fall back on. And what do people really hope?. Does anybody even care?. I bet you get a lot of compliments down there. If there's a God up in the air. Someone anekatips looking over everyone. At least you've got something to fall back on. And do you got something to say?. Is there something coming over you?. Do you got important things still left to do?

Não posso crer que o sonho acabou. Sozinho no escuro. Buscando a luz pra poder enxergar. Existe apenas um caminho. Que vai além do que se pode imaginar. Não há mais dor ou sofrimento. Bem diferente do que o mundo pode dar. (Refrão). No mundo de trevas. Sua ganância irá te matar. No mundo de angustias. Onde o medo vai te dominar. Olho pro ceu. E vejo suas mãos estendidas. Para mudar a minha vida. Vencer o medo. Vencer a guerra. Mudar o destino da terra. E alcançar a vida eterna. (Refrão)

2295,Banda Sum,Pop,I've been looking for someone. I've been searching for myself. You gotta find just one good reason. To keep going on. I've been looking up in the sky. Looking for a shining star.

2296,Banda Sum,Pop,Passa o tempo o vento sopra. Só não passa essa saudade. Imaginei tantos cenários. Nem um deles com espaço pra saudade. Amanhã eu vou te ver. Você vai sorrir pra mim. Só queria que os meus dias. Sempre fossem assim. Eu vou lembrar das nossas apostas. E das nossas brincadeiras. Os erros esquecer. E o resto é besteira. E eu vou seguir cantando pra você. Na esperança de um dia entender. O por que eu ainda corro atrás de nós dois. E se a nossa história ainda vai ter um depois. Passa o tempo o vento sopra. Só não passa essa saudade. Imaginei tantos cenários. Nem um deles com espaço pra saudade. Amanhã eu vou te ver. Você vai sorrir pra mim. Só queria que os meus dias. Sempre fossem assim. Eu vou lembrar das nossas apostas.

2297,Banda Sum,Pop,I could spend my whole life. Looking into your eyes. Cause I know you would smile. When you look into mine. I am sorry I cannot help myself. Laughing at you. You are so clumsy.

2299,Beck,Rock,Instrumental
2300,Beck,Rock,"""It takes a backwash man to sing a backwashed song. Like a frying pan when the fire's gone. Driving my pig while the bear's taking pictures. in the grass And my radio's smashed. And I like pianos in the evening sun. Dragging my heals 'til my day is done. Saturday night in the Captain's clothes. Tin horns blowing with my jewelry fros. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. I can't believe my way back when. My Cadillac pants going much to fast. Karaoke weekend at the suicide shack. Community service and I'm still the mack. Shocked my finger spicing my hand. I been spreading disease all across the land. Beautiful air-conditioned sitting in the kitchen. Wishing I was living like a hit man. Face down in the guarantees. Jaundiced marshalls getting busy with ease. Because I get down I get down I get down all the way. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. Sawdust songs of the plaid bartenders. Western Unions of the country westerns. Silver foxes looking for romance. In the chain smoke Kansas flashdance ass pants. And you got the hotwax residues. You never lose in your razor blade shoes. Stealing pesos out of my brain. Hazard signs down the Alamo lanes. Radar systems using the souls. You never get caught with the wax so rotten. All my days I got the grizzly words. Hijacked flavors that I'm flipping like birds. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. who are you?. I'm the enchanting wizard of rhythm. why did you come here?. I came here to tell you about the rhythms of the universe. *chorus translation: """"I'm a broken record I have bubblegum in my brain"""""""
2301,Beck,Rock,when they beat. on a broken guitar. and on the streets. they reek of tropical charms. the embassies lie in hideous shards. where tourists snore and decay. when they dance in a reptile blaze. you wear a mask. an equatorial haze. into the past. a colonial maze. where there's no more confetti to throw. you didn't know what to say to yourself. love is a poverty you couldn't sell. misery waiting in vague hotels. to be evicted. you're out of luck. you're singing funeral songs. to the studs. they're anabolic and bronze. they seem to strut. in their millennial fogs. 'til they fall down and deflate. you didn't know what to say to yourself. love is a poverty you couldn't sell. misery waiting in vague hotels. to be evicted. now you've had your fun. under an air-conditioned sun. it's burned into your eyes. leaves you plain and left behind. see them eyes and fall. into the jaws of a pestilent love. you didn't know what to say to yourself. love is a poverty you couldn't sell. misery waiting in vague hotels. to be a victim.
2302,Beck,Rock,She's got a cigarette on each arm. She's got the lily-white cavity crazes. She's got a carborator tied to the moon. Pink gods looking to the fruit of the ages. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's got a hand on a wheel of pain. She can talk to the mangling strangers. She can sleep in a fiery barn. Throwing troubles to the dying embers. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's got a paradise camoflauge. Like a whip-crack sending me shivers. She's a boat through a strip-mine ocean. Riding low on the drunken rivers. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution.
2303,Beck,Rock,You might fix me. You might crush me. Take a little piece of me. Start a new history. And trace it back to me. Someday you might see. That I want you. I want you. I want you. Oh I want you. I don't mind. If the sea washes. Over the city tonight. Tonight. The ground is hollow. The dark skies follow. And you don't know where you've gone. Branches on the trees have arms. The moon is a false alarm. Nothing's gonna do you harm. Except yourself. I want you. I want you. I want you. Yeah I want you. I don't mind. If the sea washes. Over the city tonight. Tonight. I'm set free. I'm set free
2304,Beck,Rock,GO IT ALONE. I'm comin over. see me down at the station. by the lane. with my hands in my pocket. jingling a wish coin. that I stole from a fountain. that was drowning all the cares in the world. When I get older. climbin up on the back porch fence. just to see the dogs runnin. with a ring and a question. and my shiverin voice is singing. thru a crack in the window. I better go it alone. down on the corner. see me standin. on a makeshift road. with the dust storm blowin. in a long black shadow. pull a hammer from a coal mine. down where your daddy was workin. comb my hair back. strike a match on a bathroom wall. where my number was written. drivin on the sidewalk. lookin back and the sky is burning. in my rearview mirror. I better go it alone
2305,Beck,Rock,I thought I heard a chainsaw. rather late last night. I woke this mornin' and I knew I was right. I got the cut-in-half blues. well the last thing I saw was the big long saw. I got the cut-in-half blues. I knew we were in trouble. I knew she lost her head. when she started bringin' all those power tools to bed. I got the cut-in-half blues. well the last thing I saw was the big long saw. I got the cut-in-half blues. (little beck skat riff). I'm layin' in my grave. all I do is grunt. cause the undertaker got all mixed up. and put my ass in the front. I got the cut-in-half blues. well the last thing I saw was the big long saw. I got the cut-in-half blues (achoo!)
2306,Beck,Rock,alcohol leavin' me dry. now it is time for pie. takin' them as they come. alcohol please give me some. if I stay in the same place. the animals will lick my face. soak in the dawn of day. rollin' my body away. alcohol leavin' me dry. now it is time for pie. takin' them as they come. alcohol please give me some.
2307,Beck,Rock,Well it's all in your mind. It's all in your mind. Well it's all in your mind. And I wanted to be. I wanted to be. Wanted to be your good friend. Well I cannot believe. You got a devil up your sleeve. And he's talking to me. And I cannot believe. And I wanted to be. I wanted to be your good friend. You're all scared and stiff. A sick stolen gift. And the people you're with. They're all scared and stiff. And I wanted to be. Wanted to be your good friend
2308,Beck,Rock,Time wears away. All the pleasures of the day. All the treasures you could hold. Days turn to sand. Losing strength in every hand. They can't hold you anymore. Already dead to me now. 'Coz it feels like I'm watching something die. Love looks away. In the harsh light of the day. On the edge of nothing more. Days fade to black. In the light of what they lack. Nothing's measured by what it needs. Already dead to me now. 'Coz it feels like I'm watching something dyinâ€™.
2309,Beck,Rock,Bazookas and fisticuffs. Medicating in Porches. 98-karat stick shift. Chinatown late-nite meals. Alfonso fiving me a backrub. 2 pm laser vizzaginal rejuvenation. Triple album project. Detonatin' tracks like these. Magnums and barrettas. Part-time hostages in pottery classes. Blind date at the wax museam. Norwegian hockey players passed out in government limos. Prime ministers with cryogenic faces. Louis Vuitton suitcases. Autographs and paid vacations. Divorce papers and synthetic lubrications. Playin' you like top-40 stations. Ah you know the deal. Arabian nites. White satellites. Voodoo is tight. Like a sleek diamond ice. Airbrushed memories strewn like pamphlets into fifth Mississippis. Time-lapse footage of duct-taped lies. Animal frequencies pinching deodorized nerves. Cosmetic procedures on the cartilage of apocalypse. Mannequin tycoons with airport piano bar mystiques. Remodeling conjugal amaracus. Flexing like suburban Spartacus. Geting smacked up by unemployed hand models. Running out into the middle of traffic with beaujolais bottles. Arabian nites. White satellites. Voodoo is tight. Like sleek diamond ice.
2310,Beck,Rock,your brains went black. when she took back her love. and put it out into the sun. the birds did fly. when the heavens all went dry. and the cigarettes were smoking by themselves. she'll do anything. she'll do anything. she'll do anything. to make you feel like an asshole. call her name. she looks the same as you. question marks stretched across her skin. she dangles carrots. makes you feel embarrassed. to be the fool you know you are. she'll do anything. she'll do anything. she'll do anything. to make you feel like an asshole.
2311,Beck,Rock,[the words are almost identical to version on.
2312,Beck,Rock,[instrumental]
2313,Beck,Rock,Black cards in effigy. We sing the song that was hated. All dressed like vagabonds. Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleedin'. I know there's something wrong. Might take a fire to kill it. Might take a hurricane. Don't know the life that I'm leavin'. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine. My baby run to me. She lives in broken-down buildings. Can't pay the rent again. These spider webs are my home now. And when the sun is down. We'll shake and rattle our bodies. To keep it warm at night. My tambourine is still shaking. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine. Doo doo doo doo. Black cards in effigy. We sing the song that was hated. All dressed like vagabonds. Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleedin'. I know there's something wrong. Might take a fire to kill it. Might take a hurricane. Don't know the life that I'm leavin'. Black tambourine. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine
2314,Beck,Rock,She's a blue cross (x4). she's a burning lawn. she's dead and gone. she's here and now. she's hangin around. she's a blue cross (x4). she's a liquor store. she's a apple core. she's a camel hair. she's a golden chair. she's a blue cross (x4). she's a silver star. she's a stolen car. she's a milky way. she's an old ashtray. she's a blue cross (x4). she's a blue cross (x4).
2315,Beck,Rock,I'm so tired of being alone. These penitent walls are all I've known. Songbird calling across the water. Inside my silent asylum. Oh don't leave me on my own. Left me standing all alone. Cut me down to size so I can fit inside. Lies that will divide us both in time. See the turncoat on his knees. A vagabond that no one sees. When a moon is throwing shadows. You can't save the ones you've caught in battle. Oh don't leave me on my own. Left me standing all alone. Cut me down to size so I can fit inside. Lies you try to hide behind your eyes. Don't leave me on my own. Don't leave me on my own. So cut me down to size so I can fit inside. Lies that will divide us both in time
2316,Beck,Rock,Long ago things to be. Ive got a garden hose and a color tv. I've got time on my hands. I've got time on my hands. nobody cares what i do. Long ago things to do. I've got a burnt orange peel and a potato stew. I've got work to get done. I've got work to get done. nobody knows where to run. I've got a quart of milk and some sound advice. I've got trees to drink. but they smell so nice. don't give me the flu. nobody knows I'm with you. back and forth I dodge a fly. like a feather in the sky. write me out a check. give me all your cash.
2317,Beck,Rock,Captain Brain's comin down. thinkin about nothin at all. who could it be?. who could it be locked inside your bathroom?.
2318,Beck,Rock,Strange ways coming today. I put a dollar in my pocket. And I threw it away. Been a long time. Since a federal dime. Made a jukebox sound. Like a mirror in my mind. Control my worries. Fix my thoughts. Throw my hopes. Like a juggernaut walks. Now let-down souls. Can't feel no rhythm. Sorry entertainers. Like aerobics victims. Hybrid people. Light a wooded matchstick. Toxic fumes and the. Burning plastic. Beats are broken. Bones are spastic. Boombox talkin'. With a southern accent. Voodoo curses. Bible tongues. Voices comin'. From the mangled lungs. Give me some grits. Some get-down shit. Don't need a good reason. To let anything rip. Radio's cold. Solar's infected. One by one. I'll knock you out. God is alone. Hardware defective. One by one. I'll knock you out. Mr. Microphone making. All the damage felt. Like a laser manifesto. Make a mannequin melt. There's people phonin' in. Like it's unlimited minutes. Going through the motions. Just to savor they did it. Treadmill's running. Underneath their feet. So they feel like they're going somewhere. But they're not. So let's put boots. On the warehouse floor. Comin' to you. Like a rope on a chainstore. Throwing equipment. From a moving van. Grab a microphone. Like a utility man. Now fix the beat. Now break the rest. Make a kick drum sound. Like an S.O.S.. Get a tow-truck. Cause it's after dark. And the dance floor's full. But everybody's double-parked!. Cell phone's dead. Lost in the desert. One by one. I'll knock you out. Eye of the sun. Is out of its socket. One by one. I'll knock you out. One by one. This jam is real... that's right. Eye of the sun. Eye of the sun. Eye of the sun. Ahhhhhhhhhh
2319,Beck,Rock,I'll clap my hands along. and rattle on like a vagabond.. I'll rip my uniform. and bend the floor. to the early mornin. I'll shake my dollar bill. and spend it all before. the bombs 'll kill me.. I'll save my best for last. and after that. don't even ask. clap hands. dudududu dudu(x5). I'll take my broken bell. and make it ring like a million churches. I'll scratch that kind of itch. down in the ditch. and switch my plates out.. I'll drive to san fransisco. death to disco. take my shirt off. I'll swim to mexico. don't tell mermaids. where I'm goin
2320,Beck,Rock,Curses I send. on these countless men. curses on their trespasses. will they never end?. curses on their blades. on the spare and open lanes. once I've been searching. recipe acclaim (??). curses on their children. runnin all around. makin such a business. while I'm rusting in the ground. I might rise up to meet them. when they leave this life. might rise up to eat them. when they leave this life. curses on this valley. and the lands on up ahead. I was on my way to meet them. when they found me dead. and I clapped my brittle hands. and I made them join my game. now I hope they all decease. and marry a man in shame. curse every word. that's planted on their lips. curse the sleek machine. and their iron colored ships. curse every wave that. pounds a wicked shore. curse every salesman. knocking on their door. and I am not a creature. and I am not a dog. I have no claim to be there. in the evening fog. and I am not a bone. staring through the air. have no say in anything. my tongue is barely there. curses on curses. I see no other way. some of them are weeping. and some of them gay. some of them have worn. so deep they feel no pain. curses on their fingers. curses on their brains.
2321,Beck,Rock,I thought I heard a chainsaw. rather late last night. I woke this mornin' and I knew I was right. I got the cut-in-half blues. well the last thing I saw was the big long saw. I got the cut-in-half blues. I knew we were in trouble. I knew she lost her head. when she started bringin' all those power tools to bed. I got the cut-in-half blues. well the last thing I saw was the big long saw. I got the cut-in-half blues. (little beck skat riff). I'm layin' in my grave. all I do is grunt. cause the undertaker got all mixed up. and put my ass in the front. I got the cut-in-half blues. well the last thing I saw was the big long saw.
2322,Beck,Rock,Some folks get their kicks steppin on ants. some folks fall for love and romance. some like to roll in the mud and laugh. my baby just likes to cut people in half. I got the cut in half blues. yeah the cut in half blues. well the last thing I saw was a big long saw. I got the cut in half blues.. Well I thought I heard a chainsaw. revving up late one night. woke the next morning cut in two. and I knew that I was right. I got the cut in half blues. yeah the cut in half blues. well the last thing I saw was a big long saw. I got the cut in half blues. (harp solo). I knew we were in trouble. And I knew we...she lost her head. when she started bringing all those. power tools to bed.. I got the cut in half blues. yeah the cut in half blues. well the last thing I saw was the big long saw.
2323,Beck,Rock,Definitely this is the wrong place to be. There's blood on the futon. There's a kid drinking fire. Going down to the sea. They got people to meet. Shaking hands with themselves. Looking out for themselves. When they ask you for credit. Give them a branch. When they want you to get it. Chew on the grass. I know I know 'cause they told me to tell you. There's nothing to tell you. There's nothing to sell you. In the afternoon. Riding the scapegoat. Burning equipment. Decomposing. Cool off your jets. Take off your sweats. I got a funny feeling they got plastic in the. afterlife. When they want you to cry. Leap into the sky. When they suck your mind. Like a pigeon you'll fly. I know I know. It's the positive people. Running from their time. Looking for some feeling
2324,Beck,Rock,Instrumental
2325,Beck,Rock,I put my voice away. I shoot the lights out now. Seize the moment. When it's day for night to disappear. Lonesome stragglers. Walks a dirty mile. No longer sees. Miles on our faces. I put my voice away. I train my eyes on love. Through the darkened lines. Left to pull up traps on my face. And with hearts to laugh. Messing up our heads. Only souls survive. The weather of commotion
2326,Beck,Rock,defecate monkey brains. a piss smell all is well. regurgitate misused function. hell. seedy contractor amoral inbred. rubbercoated asshole. you know how to use it. defecate your brains. shitstain anagram. now its gettin outta hand. fuck form well sink into oblivion. no new news swimmin in semen. cut your throat so you stop breathin.
2327,Beck,Rock,Must have been the devil. Believe. That woman has gone mad. Must a been the devil. Believe. That woman has gone mad. Nothing' but the devil. Change my baby's mind. Nothing but the devil. Change my baby's mind. Laid down last night. Laid down last night. Laid there last night. And tried to take my rest. My mind got to rambling'. Like wild geese. From the west. Must have been the devil. Believe. That woman has gone mad. Must have been the devil. Believe. That woman has gone mad. Woman I love. Woman I love. Took off. With my best friend. Woman I love. Took off. With my best friend
2328,Beck,Rock,musta been the devil. b'lieve that woman has gone now. musta been the devil. b'lieve that woman has gone now. nothin but the devil. change my baby's mind. nothing but the devil. could change my baby's mind. laid down last night. laid down last night. laid there last night. and tried to take my rest. mmm I got to ramble. and wire ??? from the west. all night long. all night long. life of my best friend.
2329,Beck,Rock,Looking back at some dead world. That looks so new. Offices and fountains that they named for you. Dazzlements of accidents. Rejoice their doom. Hari-karis spinning round the golden looms. Girl you dream infections. From a nauseous heart. Choice cut meats. From derelict boulevards. Hear that lonesome whistle blow. No direction to be known. In a senile revelry. A tearful gaze turns away. Emoting cold and grey. Scented eunuchs. Clothe our wretchedness. Looking back at some dead world. That looks so new. Offices and fountains that they named for you. So ungrateful to the who's and what's-his-face. Terrorist confections. Look so out of place. Looking back at some dead world. That looks so new. Looking back at some dead world. That looks so new. Looking back at some dead world. That looks so new. Looking back at some dead world. That looks so new. Looking back at some dead world. That looks so new
2330,Beck,Rock,See me comin to town with my soul. Straight down out of the world with my fingers. Holding onto the devil I know. All my troubles'll hang on your trigger. Take your eyes and your mind from the road. Shoot your mouth off but look where you're aiming. Don't forget to pick up what you sow. Talking trash to the garbage around you. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. See me kickin the door with my boots. Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish. Snakes and bones in the back of your room. Handing out a confection of venom. Heaven's drunk from the poison you use. Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler. Now I see it's a comfort to you. Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. I won't give up that ghost. It's sick the way these tongues are twisted. The good in us is all we know. There's too much left to taste that's bitter. I won't give up that ghost. It's sick the way these tongues are twisted. The good in us is all we know. There's too much left to taste that's bitter
2331,Beck,Rock,Heyyy heyyy heyyy heyyy. Fourteen miles away from a landfill grave. Never pawned my watch and chain. To the landlord living inside my head. Never paid my rent 'til the lights went dead. And I saw my sign coming up the road. Dead ditch waitin' for to bury my load. On the avenues in the plain of day. Threw a Roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain. Ohh ohh oh oh. Ohh ohh oh oh. Now hold your hand up to the plow. Work the dirt til the sun goes down. What's left of death is more than fear. Let dust be dust and the good Lord near. It's a little too much to ask of faith. A little too late to wait for fate. So tell the angels what you've seen. Scarecrow's shadow on the Nazarene. Ohh ohh oh oh. Ohh ohh oh oh. Kindness will find you. When darkness is falling round your bend. Kindness will follow. Children will wander 'til the end
2332,Beck,Rock,Offices and fountains they named for you. Stacks and zealots wither in shit-filled rooms. Hari-karis barely a tear for you. Hairy fairies spinning the golden looms. Wake up the ghosts and lepers. Aching in their slavery smoke. Delinquent hygienes atrocious. We'll shoot out the great white crescent. We'll shoot out the great white crescent. Fisticuffs and zithers of Zanzibar. Body pills that shiver the caviar. Dazzlements and accidents body's chart. Choice cut meats of derelict boulevards. Wake up the ghosts and lepers. Aching up their slavery smoke. Delinquent hygienes atrocious. We'll shoot out the great white crescent. We'll shoot out the great white crescent. Wake up the ghosts and lepers. Aching in their slavery smoke. Delinquent hygienes atrocious. We'll shoot out the great white crescent. We'll shoot out the great white crescent

2334,Beck,Rock,You might fix me. You might crush me. Take a little piece of me. Start a new history. And trace it back to me. Someday you might see. That I want you. I want you. I want you. Oh I want you. I don't mind. If the sea washes. Over the city tonight. Tonight. The ground is hollow. The dark skies follow. And you don't know where you've gone. Branches on the trees have arms. The moon is a false alarm. Nothing's gonna do you harm. Except yourself. I want you. I want you. I want you. Yeah I want you. I don't mind. If the sea washes. Over the city tonight. Tonight. I'm set free. I'm set free
2335,Beck,Rock,stand outside with a suitcase. (there's a forcefield round my neck). walk around all the while. (and it stands just where I sat). look at the people driving backwards. (and the stance I took on that). no particular style. (leaves that forcefield round my back). don't let it get near you. don't let it get too close. don't let it turn you into. (and the stance I took on that). the things you hate the most. (leaves a forcefield round my neck). roll out your silver-dollar coffins. pull out your buckskin gloves. tell them anything you want to. the sound comes from above. don't let it get near you. don't let it get too close. don't let it turn you into. (and the stance I took on that). the things you hate the most. (leaves a forcefield round my neck). don't let it get near you. don't let it get too close. don't let it turn you into. the things you hate the most. (there's a forcefield round my neck). (and it stands just where I sat). (and the stance I took on that). (leaves a forcefield round my neck). (there's a forcefield round my neck). (and it stands just where I've set). (and the stance I took on that). (leaves a forcefield round my neck).
2336,Beck,Rock,you're just the girl of my dreams but it seems. my dreams never come true. you're just the girl of my dreams but it seems. my dreams never come true. I first met you down on lover's lane. the birds were insane. flapping all about. softly you would sing. swinging in your swing. it wasn't night it wasn't day. you're just the girl of my dreams but it seems. my dreams never come true. you're just the girl of my dreams but it seems. my dreams never come true. you're just the girl of my dreams but it seems. my dreams never come true.
2337,Beck,Rock,GO IT ALONE. I'm comin over. see me down at the station. by the lane. with my hands in my pocket. jingling a wish coin. that I stole from a fountain. that was drowning all the cares in the world. When I get older. climbin up on the back porch fence. just to see the dogs runnin. with a ring and a question. and my shiverin voice is singing. thru a crack in the window. I better go it alone. down on the corner. see me standin. on a makeshift road. with the dust storm blowin. in a long black shadow. pull a hammer from a coal mine. down where your daddy was workin. comb my hair back. strike a match on a bathroom wall. where my number was written. drivin on the sidewalk. lookin back and the sky is burning. in my rearview mirror. I better go it alone
2338,Beck,Rock,go where you want to. do the things you feel. walk around with a broken leg. and a hundred dollar bill. get yourself a pistol. get yourself a dog. stay up all night gettin drunk. sleepin in a log. walk 'til you're restless. sleep 'til you're tired. wake up without thinking. you're the one that I desired.
2339,Beck,Rock,Tonight the city is full of....radios. and all the distortion pedals are melted. there's Sonic Youth posters nailed up onto the...ceiling. and the roof is falling down on my brain. that's why. I got no mind. I got no mind. got no mind. somebody burned down the picnic. and somebody kissed their own ass by mistake. and the cliches are gettin eaten up. by the termites with the malt liquor. and the guitar tuners and the Pussy Galore song. that's why. I play all night. I got no mind. feel so fine. . and the big radio sound is pumping up and down. jumpin thru the hoops. making every motion seem like forever. there's air conditioning and brand new nails. and phone calls from people in Chicago. ...why. pay no mind. got no mind. stay outside. so turn up the levels. and talk to your devils. and bust out your tennis shoes and your mayonnaise. it's all the situations and all the celebrations. and all the contaminations that make you. breed off the carpet. that's why. I pay no mind. (cough) got no mind. might need a cough drop. well there's verses and sounds. falling like pounds and pounds of. sand weights from the heavens. and she dangles like a bottle. talkin thru the steering wheels. and broken pantyhose. that's why. I pay no mind. sleep in slime. put out CDs. the amplifiers are amplifying. the things that you never knew. could ever be the same as you. there's wires and plugs. and slugs slithering out into the paint thinner. that's why. I pay no mind. I pay no mind. got no mind. your swivel chairs and sunglasses. and your fully-blown out scenes of ecstasy. turn up the volume and the treble. and call them all the nasty things that you can. stick into your paper. with your pen. shove your pen up into the air. write everything and. like you just don't care. but it feels good. when you pull off the scenery. and there's puppets and dollar bills. and there's weight-loss pills. and there's cherries and there's potato chips. and the time is runnin low. and there's nowhere else to go. so let's go down. 666 up into. I'm raising all my lows.
2340,Beck,Rock,There's a bluebird at my window. I can't hear the songs he sings. All the jewels in Heaven. They don't look the same to me. I just wade the tides that turned. Till i learn to leave the past behind. It's only lies that i'm living. It's only tears that i'm crying. It's only you that i'm losing. Guess i'm doing fine. All the battlements are empty. And the moon is laying low. Yellow roses in the graveyard. Got no time to watch them grow. Now i bade a friend farewell. I can do whatever pleases me. It's only lies that i'm living. It's only tears that i'm crying. It's only you that i'm losing. Guess i'm doing fine. Press my face up to the window. To see how warm it is inside. See the things that i've been missing. Missing all this time. It's only lies that i'm living. It's only tears that i'm crying. It's only you that i'm losing. Guess i'm doing fine. Guess i'm doing fine.
2341,Beck,Rock,You said go. You said stay. Got so confused. I tried to do both. So I broke out in a sweat. Cashed my check. And I spent it to death. 'Cause its hard to compete. It's hard to eat. When you're beating your fist on the ground. And it's rude. Did you ever even think about the impression. you gave to the pigs. To the kids. With the hazardous waste in their wine. And their eyes. Their gasoline hairstyles. Workin' their magic for you. You said go. You said stay. You said try a combination. Didn't know where to start. I was lost. I was beige. I was over and under my age. Like a video. Like a chick. Like a dead man moving to quick. In my way. Had no plan. Dealin' out papers into the wastecan. Tryin' hard to stay awake. And the rest of the best was a big mistake. So let's drive. Right into the ground. Hold it down with the garbageman-clown. 'Cause it's a deal. It's a noose. It's news. It's pennies.
2342,Beck,Rock,go where you want to. do the things you feel. walk around with a broken leg. and a hundred-dollar bill. get yourself a pistol. get yourself a dog. stay up all night getting drunk. sleeping on a hollow log. walk 'til you're restless. sleep 'til you're tired. wake up without thinking. you're the one that I desired.
2343,Beck,Rock,They know it's ??. This ?? blindfold. When she crawls from the Himalayan rain. Where the birds of prey are weapons on fire. She's ridin' a landslide down to me. Gettin' the desert under me. Shakin' the dead birds from the trees. Singing the only air we breathe. ?? promise in the plate glass summer. Don't call it death ?? plan. She's ridin' a landslide down to me. Sing the shackles off of me. Shakin' the dead birds from the trees. ?? the blood that I have ??. Comin' to see herself again. Comin' to sing her song again. Comin' to watch it all. Comin' to see herself again. Comin' to see herself again. Comin' to watch it all
2344,Beck,Rock,"""It takes a backwash man to sing a backwashed song. Like a frying pan when the fire's gone. Driving my pig while the bear's taking pictures. in the grass And my radio's smashed. And I like pianos in the evening sun. Dragging my heals 'til my day is done. Saturday night in the Captain's clothes. Tin horns blowing with my jewelry fros. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. I can't believe my way back when. My Cadillac pants going much to fast. Karaoke weekend at the suicide shack. Community service and I'm still the mack. Shocked my finger spicing my hand. I been spreading disease all across the land. Beautiful air-conditioned sitting in the kitchen. Wishing I was living like a hit man. Face down in the guarantees. Jaundiced marshalls getting busy with ease. Because I get down I get down I get down all the way. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. Sawdust songs of the plaid bartenders. Western Unions of the country westerns. Silver foxes looking for romance. In the chain smoke Kansas flashdance ass pants. And you got the hotwax residues. You never lose in your razor blade shoes. Stealing pesos out of my brain. Hazard signs down the Alamo lanes. Radar systems using the souls. You never get caught with the wax so rotten. All my days I got the grizzly words. Hijacked flavors that I'm flipping like birds. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. who are you?. I'm the enchanting wizard of rhythm. why did you come here?. I came here to tell you about the rhythms of the universe. *chorus translation: """"I'm a broken record I have bubblegum in my brain"""""""
2345,Beck,Rock,"""celebration. pineapples and kumquats. simultaneously exploding. cokes in the fruit of eternity. lighting matchsticks and candles. drawing pictures with god. ????. severing the tires of god. covering yourselves with masking tape. ???. [unintelligible stuff and noise]. """"lacksadaisical"""" fermented elastic. comatose."""
2346,Beck,Rock,well there ain't nobody left to impress. and everyone's kissing their own hands. this 666 on the kitchen floor. ain't no fire in the pan. I get lonesome.... so glad to be a slab. stiff as a stick on a board. I get thoughts and dirty socks. piled in the corner. I get lonesome.... getting fat on your own fear. bring that beer over here. I stomp on the floor. just to make a sound. I get lonesome....
2347,Beck,Rock,from these shores where we belong. I have seen the the land beyond. where the Lord is strange and strong. I have seen the the land beyond. there's no telling who'll be dead. when the pale horse is turning red. and the tongues will burn in vain. and everything will feel the same. there's no patience there's no peace. I have seen the land beyond. where the gravestones never cease. I have seen the the land beyond. through the troubles of years. the heavenly apparition appears. and we're haunted by our own minds. and the spirit comes(?) in the skies (with no eyes). from these shores where we belong. I have seen the the land beyond. I'll be there and I'll be gone. I have seen the the land beyond.
2348,Beck,Rock,well it's all in your mind. well it's all in your mind. it's all in your mind. well it's all in your mind. and I wanted to be. and I wanted to be. your good friend. well I cannot believe. you got a devil up your sleeve. and he's talking to me. and I cannot believe. and I wanted to be. and I wanted to be. your good friend. well you're all scared and stiff. a sick stolen gift. and the people you're with. they're all scared and stiff. and I wanted to be. and I wanted to be. your good friend.
2349,Beck,Rock,I been drifting along in the same stale shoes. Loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind. If you thought that you were making your way. To where the puzzles and pagans lay. I'll put it together: It's a strange invitation. When I wake up someone will sweep up my lazy bones. And we will rise in the cool of the evening. I remember the way that you smiled. When the gravity shackles were wild. And something is vacant when I think it's all beginning. I been drifting along in the same stale shoes. Loose ends tying the noose in the back of my mind. If you thought that you were making your way. To where the puzzles and pagans lay. I'll put it together: It's a strange invitation.
2350,Beck,Rock,Who's calling my name?. I hear the voice of legends?. What do I want?. Static enotion comes down. Did I have the dream?. Am I misunderstood?. Static emotion comes down
2351,Beck,Rock,musta been the devil. b'lieve that woman has gone now. musta been the devil. b'lieve that woman has gone now. nothin but the devil. change my baby's mind. nothing but the devil. could change my baby's mind. laid down last night. laid down last night. laid there last night. and tried to take my rest. mmm I got to ramble. and wire ??? from the west. all night long. all night long. life of my best friend. mm I got to ramble
2352,Beck,Rock,I don't want no cryin'. all upon my sleeve. I just want somebody. who got no place to be. you call me up on tuesday. I'll be stuck on Sunday night. lookin' for some good things. to make me feel alright. when I snap my fingers. when I walk the line. when I get my money. I'll be killin' time. time is killin' something. it's just to small to care. runnin' through the jungle. lookin' for your hair. someone's talkin' backwards. lookin' for a fight. puttin' on a lampshade. cuz you're shinin' way too bright. I don't want no cryin. I don't want no pain. I don't want no lonesome life. on a broken train.
2353,Beck,Rock,Lonesome tears. I can't cry them anymore. I can't think of what they're for. Oh they ruin me every time. But I'll try. And leave behind some days. These tears just can't erase. I don't need them anymore. How could this love ever-turning. Never turn its eye on me?. How could this love ever-changing. Never change the way I feel?. Lazy sun. Your eyes catch the light. With the promises that might. Come true for a while. Oh I'll ride. Farther than I should. Harder than I could. Just to meet you there. How could this love ever-turning. Never turn its eye on me?. How could this love ever-changing. Never change the way I feel?
2354,Beck,Rock,I wanna be your dog. Three time around and bark. Do everything what you want. Three time around and bark. Do everything what you want. In this mad house(woo woo). In this mad house(woo woo). In this mad house i'm doggiedog. I will show my belly for you. Put my hand on you again. I will show my belly for you. Put my hand on you again. You again. You again. I wanna be your dog. Three time around and bark. Do everything what you want. Three time around and bark. Do everything what you want. In this mad house(woo woo). In this mad house(woo woo). In this mad house i'm doggiedog
2355,Beck,Rock,Put my bony fingers on my sliding coffin. Drag upon the rag. It's a thing we gotta do. Kill my inspiration. Drowning in your Stationwagon. Pushing like a fishing pole. And just to spread the leg on the cracker. And the magic chicken claw
2356,Beck,Rock,a sparkle in the night (?). she glides. tainted by the affliction. seduced...deeply into myself. faceless...emerging.
2357,Beck,Rock,Don't take your red ribbons off. You're about to make a fool of yourself. In the aluminum sunset. Drinking from a drain. I'm a hundred miles behind myself. Milk and honey. Pouring down like money. Make a poor boy wanna run. Milk and Honey. Do you wanna love me. Under the aluminum sun. Did you hear those war torn stories. Where the lifeguards slept in the streets. In the jungle lands. With the cold cola cans. You'll get the keys to the city for free. Milk and honey. Pouring down like money. Bring a poor boy to his knees. Milk and honey. No it isn't funny. Living in a garden of sleaze. Bangkok athletes in the biosphere. Arkansas wet dreams. We all disappear. Kremlin mistress. Rings the buddah chimes. She slips me ruffies. Receding hairlines. She's all right...touching my body. She's all right...on my computer. She's all right...selling me watches. She's all right...ring on my finger.
2358,Beck,Rock,The last survivor of a boiled crown. Another casualty with the casual frown. The janitor vandals they bark in your face. Juveniles with the piles and paste. It's a sensation. A bankrupt corpse. In the garbage classes. With the crutches of frogs(?). Don't be confused when your fuse is up. And you're taking a leak into your brother's cup. When the cup is filled you can run and be killed. In the billion miles of the muscles that build. Radiation. Feeling the force. Karaoke. Vomiting morons. The scalps of zero hailing the call. Rubbing in a blind man's running mall(???). With the canker sores and the robot pills. Throwing imbeciles on the window sills. It's a sensation. A bankrupt corpse. In the garbage classes. With the crutches of frogs(?). Frogs!. Frogs!. Frogs!. (?).
2359,Beck,Rock,MISSING. I prayed heaven today. would bring its hammer down on me. and pound you out of my head. I can't think with you in it. I dragged all that I owned. down a dirt road to find you. my shoes worn out and used. they can't take me much farther. something always takes the place of missing pieces. you can take and put together even though. you know there's something missing. the sun burned a hole in my roof. I can't seem to fix it. I hope the rain doesn't come. and wash me down the gutter. she rides in a car like a queen on a card. and the guns of her mind aim a line. straight at mine to a heart that was broke. tried to feel but got choked in the smoke of. a desert a beach with no treasure. a night that's so blue feed the aching in you and the background birds take a flight from the earth. where the bonfire burns and the night. current turns on a lifeboat floating. down a river of sleep. I can't see her hollow eyes. I'm walkin' along with my boots full of rocks. I can't believe these tears were mine. I'll give them to you to keep away in a box. something always takes the place of. missing pieces you can take and put together even though. you know there's something missing. something always missing always. someone missing something
2360,Beck,Rock,I'm mixing business with leather. Christmas with Heather. Freaks flock together. And make all the b-boys scream. All right. Turn it up now. All right. Turn it up now. Word up to the manthing. She's always cold lamping. Visine at the canteen. I just wanna watch you dance. Do you wanna ride on the Baltic Sea. I'll be your mistress C.O.D.. I'll comb your hair. Re-write your diary. Pour champagne on a honey bee. She can really do me. She can look right through me. And make all the b-boys scream. I'm mixing fitness with leather. Homework with Heather. Freaks flock together. And make all the lesbians scream. All right. Turn it up now. All right. Turn it up now.
2361,Beck,Rock,These toys are all lifeless. The armor's worn off. The shadow of a shadow. Is the ghost of a bomb. Skyscraper standing. In a desert alone. A helicopter searchlight. Is searching for no-one. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. The smokestack clouds with glory attached. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. The smokestack clouds with glory attached. The sky creatures dance. In a parking lot wind. That blows from a tundra. Where the jungle begins. If there's hope in a roadblock. Guns in a church. The lord will take his motorcade. And drive us into the dirt. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. The smokestack clouds with glory attached. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. The smokestack clouds with glory attached. There's a skyscraper on the moon. And a man standing on a window. Forty-second floor. There's a light beaming through the galaxy. Telling me everything's gonna be OK. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
2362,Beck,Rock,Looking for a ladder. In the stratosphere. So I can be happy. Let my problems melt away. Running on a plane. With a cigarette. I carry my heart. Like a soldier with a hand grenade. Walking down the aisle. Of the supermarket. Looking for the ??. To carry my senses away. Listen to a voice. On the telephone. Somebody's calling. Somebody on the way. Looking for a home. In the magazine page. Wages in my pocket. Gonna buy me anything I need. Thought in my brain. Batting an eye. Washing away. ??. I'm not scared. 'Cause there's nobody there. Mind is awake. Nothing's gonna lead me astray. Listen to the voice. On the radio wave. Somebody needs you. Somebody who is. On their way
2363,Beck,Rock,When the ocean's are dark. The heavens are foreboding. A chain link wind. Is breaking you open. And lessons of day. On the blackboard of night. That seem to be erased. And the beacon has no light. The eyes of confusion. Looking for a stray. And everything they need. Keep the dogs at bay. There's no escape hatch. No submarine. Can take you to the moon. And rake you in the leaves. And keep you just as safe. As you are in my arms. And someday someday. Say bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. You're smaller than a stone. Bigger than a road. Farther than an ocean. Closer than a soul. Every little word. And every little step. Every new direction. Closer you will get. And farther away. You go from where we are. And try to keep him with you. And hold him like a star. That has fallen frozen lake. To a heart to break. And push yourself beyond. The wall that coffins you. When you bring it down. All the false sides. When you make him yours. Don't forget he's yours. Bye-bye
2364,Beck,Rock,I'll be your chauffeur on a midnight drive. It takes a miracle just to survive. Buried animals call your name. You keep on sleeping. Through the poignant rain. I think we're going crazy. Her left eye is lazy. She looks so Israeli. Nicotine and gravy. I'll feed you fruit that don't exist. I'll leave graffiti. Where you've never been kissed. I'll do your laundry. Massage your soul. I'll turn you over. To the highway patrol. I think we're going crazy. Things don't even faze me. Her left eye is lazy. Nicotine and gravy. Miracles amaze me. She looks so Israeli. Love the way she plays me. I think I'm going crazy. I don't want to die tonight. I don't want to die tonight…...
2365,Beck,Rock,there was no one nothing to see. the night is useless and so are we. cause everybody knows. the fabric of folly is fallen apart at the seams. and i've been lookin' for a good time. but the pleasures are seldom and few. there's no whiskey there's no wine. just the concrete and a worried mind. cos everone knows death creeps in slow. til you feel safe in his arms. and i've been lookin' for a new friend. and i don't care if he's decrepit and grey. o maria haven't you known. days so careless. all on your own. everybody knows the circus is closed. and the animals have gone wild. and i've been lookin' for my shadow. but this place is so bright and so clean. there was no one nothing to see. the night is useless and so are we. cause everybody knows. the fabric of folly is fallen apart at the seams. and i've been lookin' for a good time. but the pleasures are seldom and few.
2366,Beck,Rock,one of these days. i hope it's soon. i'll see you smiling. the way you do. walkin' on splinters. somewhere unknown. it's getting better. that much i know. one of these days. one of these days. i'm gonna love you all my life. one of these days. one of these days. i'm gonna let the world blow by. cardboard faces. with nowhere to look. one in a million. that's how long it took. up on the bridge. nowhere to go. empty and cold. burnin' a light bulb. one of these days. one of these days. i'm gonna love you all my life. one of these days. one of these days. i'm gonna let the world blow by. one of these days. one of these days. one of these days. one of these days. one of these days. one of these days. one of these days. one of these days. one of these days. one of these days.
2367,Beck,Rock,seventeen years in the city. static clinging to the ceiling. never did I think it would come to this. (outcome is different than I expected). never did I think it would come to this. (outcome is different than I expected). bright cops and cheerleaders. eyebrows painted on their heads. a mouthfull of rotting cavities. drinking coca-cola in the street. never did I think it would come to this. (outcome is different than i expected). never did I think it would come to this. (outcome is different than I expected). shot in the leg. shot in the leg. my leg is a bone. nobody home. my hand is a wire. the skies are fire. the drums are beating. pistols and jeans. left for dead. left for dead. left for dead. dead as a fly.
2368,Beck,Rock,I wake up and look upon your painted eyelids. the world is your oyster. and the trashbags are your kids. the ceiling is invisible. there's a bird sinkin' through the sky. and every hour that passes. is teachin me how to cry. cuz it's lonely here. in the ugly part of town. the buildings are all vacant. and the telephones are down. there's a police siren singing. like a tiger with no skin. the sewer drain is glowing. and I don't know what state I'm in. and the river is on fire. there's chemicals in the breeze. and all the roads are blocked off. cuz they're just too hard to see. so cancel my appointments. and set up a whole new show. cuz I'm in need of a good hot meal. and a life to call my own. so get me a plate of money. and get me a blanket and a chair. the limitations are limitless. they're floating through the air. because it's real and it's true. the things I see in you. and there's nothing I wouldn't talk about.
2369,Beck,Rock,Just like a paper tiger. Torn apart by idle hands. Through the helter skelter morning. Fix yourself while you still can. No more ashes to ashes. No more cinders from the sky. All the laws of creation. Tell a dead man how to die. O deserts down below us. And storms up above. Like a stray dog gone defective. Like a paper tiger in the sun. Looking through a broken diamond. To make the past what it should be. Through the ruins and the weather. Capsized boats in the sea. O deserts down below us. And storms up above. Like a stray dog gone defective. Like a paper tiger in the sun. Weæ± e just holding on to nothing. To see how long nothing lasts. O deserts down below us. And storms up above. Like a stray dog gone defective.
2370,Beck,Rock,(This is song two on the album. This is the album right here. Burn the album). Tonight the city is full of morgues. And all the toilets are overflowing. There's shopping malls coming out of the walls. As we walk out among the manure. That's why. I pay no mind. I pay no mind. I pay no mind. Give the finger to the rock 'n' roll singer. As he's dancing upon your paycheck. The sales climb high through the garbage-pail sky. Like a giant dildo crushing the sun. That's why. I pay no mind. Sleep in slime. I just got signed. So get out your lead-pipe pipe dreams. Get out your ten-foot flags. The insects are huge and the poison's all been used. And the drugs won't kill your day job...honey. That's why. I pay no mind [3x]. That's why. I pay no mind [x7]
2371,Beck,Rock,Don't tell your right hand baby. What your left hand do. You know those road check girls. Will make your brown breath blue. Peaches and Cream. You make a garbage man scream. Such a dangerous dream. Peaches and Cream….. You look good in that sweater. And that aluminum crutch. I'm gonna let you down easy. I've got a delicate touch. Peaches and Cream. You make a garbage man scream. Come on girl it's a dream. You're a torn out page. From a best selling book. Your home girl's on the line. But your daddy's off the hook. Where do we go now?. Give those pious soldiers. Another lollipop. Cause we're on the good ship. Menage et tois. Peaches and Cream. You make a garbage man scream. Such a delicate thing. Keep your lamplight trimmed and burning.
2372,Beck,Rock,Instrumental

2374,Beck,Rock,The countryside is overgrown. There's a lighthouse in her soul. Wrestling with butcher girls. She don't ever change her clothes. Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears. I could sleep inside her bones. A hundred years. Lizards in the pressure zone. Mother knows it's only a phase. Cherry gardens feel like ice. Hazard lights from her past. Underneath the broken bridge. Hookers hug illegal dads. Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears. I could sleep inside her bones. A hundred years. Lizards in the pressure zone. Mother knows it's only a phase.
2375,Beck,Rock,In a cast iron cage you couldn't help but stare like a creature. With the laws of a brothel and the fireproof bones of a preacher. And your lingo coined from the sacrament of a casino. On a government loan with a guillotine in your libido. Who's gonna answer. Profanity prayers. Who's gonna answer. These profanity prayers. Well you know how it looks when you pull all your books from the table. And you stare into space trying to discern what to say now. And you wait at the light and watch for a sign that you're breathing. Cos you can't just live on air and float to the ceiling. Who's gonna answer. Profanity prayers. Who's gonna answer. Profanity prayers. Who's gonna answer. Profanity prayers. Who's gonna answer. Profanity prayers

She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's got a hand on a wheel of pain. She can talk to the mangling strangers. She can sleep in a fiery barn. Throwing troubles to the dying embers. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's got a paradise camoflauge. Like a whip-crack sending me shivers. She's a boat through a strip-mine ocean. Riding low on the drunken rivers. She's alone in the new pollution.

It's getting darker. We dance alone this way. I'm gonna grab a train. Gonna break the hope. I put the life beating out. Like a stray in a boat. Let the scenery pass. Like a blown-out TV. Thought I saw a ghost. But it might have been me. Might have been the world. That was moving too fast. Caught up in the future. That was coming to pass. Now looking for a place. Where the lights unravel. Last ditch road. Trespassers travel on. Darker. We dance alone this way. It's getting darker. We dance alone this way. We dance alone this way

Of growing old. She'll never be in second place. She'll never be in second place. I see it in her. I hear it in her. I feel it in her. I know it's in her. She's magic. Magic. Always alright.

But i'll never let you go. I'll never let you fall.. When your hands lose their grip and your slippery fingers start to slip. It doesn't matter at all. I'll never let you fall.

2420,Ben Kweller,Rock,Nothing Happening. . Like sun though the night. Just to get it right. A battle ground at my feet. An unwinable fight. The words we say won't matter anyhow. Let's focus on tomorrow. Instead of right now. Nothing happening. It's all illusion. It's all illusion. Nothing happening. It's all confusion. It's all confusion. All around this room tonight. Now there's nothing we can do. To make each other feel alright. Instead of trying to tell me how to be. Just focus on tomorrow instead of on me. Nothing happening. It's all illusion. It's all confusion. If we want to keep this love we found. We've got to focus on tomorrow. Instead of right now. Nothing happening. It's all illusion. It's all illusion. Nothing happening. It's all confusion. It's all confusion. It's all confusion. Nothing is happening. It's all illusion. It's all illusion. Nothing is happening. It's all confusion. It's all confusion.

2421,Ben Kweller,Rock,Red Eye. Trying to keep up with you. I'm losing speed. Worrying about you. How long will it take. 'Til I can have your heart to break?. Red eye. I'm asking you. Your beautiful fear. Is the Holy Ghost town. Let's close in the road. We used to drive down. How long will it take. 'Til I can have your heart to break?. Red eye. I'm asking you. You know I hate the way. Your love don't stay. Red eye. I'm asking you. Your eyelids don't shut. But you don't see me here. When I need to be saved. The queen disappears. How long will it take. 'Til I can have your heart to break?. Red eye. I'm asking you. You know I hate the way. Your love don't stay. Red eye. Do you have to have to fly all night. Just to feel all right?. Red eye. I'm asking you
2422,Ben Kweller,Rock,Thirteen. . . We've been in the rain. We've been on the mountain. We've been round the fire. In fancy hotels. Drank water from farm wells. We sang with the choir. I kissed your dry lips. We jumped off the high cliffs. And splashed down below. Skin to skin. In the salty river. Made love in the shadow. Woooah ooh. Read books to each other. Read the mind of the other. Flew one thousand (jets?). We laughed and we cried. At movies and real life. In our ridiculous beds. We danced in the moonlight at midnight. We pressed against back doors and wooden floors. And you never faked it. And frequently. We ignored our love. But we could never mistake it. Oooh ooh. We met on the front porch. Fell in love on the phone. Without the physical wreck. You gave me the necklace. That used to hang. Around your mothers neck. We questioned religions. Fed bread to the pigeons. We learned how to pray. We stood by the ocean. Turned our hearts in to one. We laid in bed all day. Heeey. We skipped on the sidewalk. Skipped stones on the water. We skipped town. We've seen the sunrise with new eyes. We've seen the damage of gossip and true lies. We've seen the sun go down. Had passionate makeouts. And passionate freakouts. We built this world of our own. It was in the back of a taxi. When you told me you loved me

Cuz I got to knock you out. Are you ready for a surprise?. I don't even think you even realize. They say that you're the best. You gotta follow all the rest. This is war. Yeah yeah yeah. This is war. I can't be your friend. Cuz I gotta knock you out. So I can win.
2424,Ben Kweller,Rock,Until I Die. . I'm so sorry I'm so paranoid. It's something in my head. That I can't avoid. And I want to be with you. And always will. Until I die. Until I die. Until I die. I'm so sorry that I've been like this. You're the one thing in this world. I don't want to miss. And I want to be with you. And always will. Until I die. Until I die. Until I die. Frost on the window. I'm in for the night. You've got a phone. Keep me in mind. Just give me a try. I'm so sorry that I've been so sad. But you are the best friend that I've ever had. And I love you. And always will. Until I die. Frost on the window. I'm in for the night. You've got a phone. Give me a try. It's still on my mind. So sorry I'm so paranoid. I'm so sorry I'm so paranoid.

2425,Berlin,Rock,Watching every motion. In my foolish lover's game. On this endless ocean. Finally lovers know no shame. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn around and say. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching I keep waiting. Still anticipating love. Never hesitating. To become the fated ones. Turning and returning. To some secret place to hide. Watching in slow motion. As you turn to me and say. My love. Take my breath away. Through the hourglass I saw you. In time you slipped away. When the mirror crashed I called you. And turned to hear you say. If only for today. I am unafraid. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching every motion. In this foolish lover's game. Haunted by the notion. Somewhere there's a love in flames. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn my way and say. Take my breath away.

2432,Berlin,Rock,There's a pain in my head. And a hole in my bed. Where you used to lay. Yesterday. There's a cat on our roof. And he howls at the moon. No one hears his plea. Sounds a lot like me. How does it feel to wake up. Alone every night. With no one to hold you. And tell you everything's alright. Go ask the lonely. How it feels to cry. Go ask the lonely how it hurts inside. Go ask the lonely how it feels to be free. Don't ask me. Got some time on my hands. Got these chains off my feet. Oh does it mean. My life's complete. There's a song in my heart. And I keep going on. But that doesn't mean it's easy to be strong. Whatever happened to all our hopes and dreams. Whatever happened to you and me. You and me. Go ask the lonely. How it feels to cry. Go ask the lonely how it hurts inside. Go ask the lonely how it feels to be free. Don't ask me
2433,Berlin,Rock,Cool and so breezy. Take it or leave it. Keeping your distance. Arrows to your heart just bounce away. I see you bleeding. The poison is spreading. So cleanse yourself with tears of salvation. Forget the pain. Hideaway in my arms. Where's the shame. Cry away there's no harm. Lost in a nightmare. Falling through thin air. Faster and faster. Love is getting closer and closer. It's time that you wake up. From haircuts and makeup. No need to be frightened. Trust in the love that you dream of. You'll be my hero. Start back at zero. Throw off your mask. Freedom at last. Trust in a needed friend
2434,Berlin,Rock,Revvin' up your engine. Listen to her howlin' roar. Metal under tension. Beggin' you to touch and go. Highway to the Danger Zone. Ride into the Danger Zone. Headin' into twilight. Spreadin' out her wings tonight. She got you jumpin' off the track. And shovin' into overdrive. Highway to the Danger Zone. I'll take you. Right into the Danger Zone. You'll never say hello to you. Until you get it on the red line overload. You'll never know what you can do. Until you get it up as high as you can go. Out along the edges. Always where I burn to be. The further on the edge. The hotter the intensity. Highway to the Danger Zone. Gonna take you. Right into the Danger Zone. Highway to the Danger Zone
2435,Berlin,Rock,Face to face with my demons. Tearing apart everything I've done. And I don't have a parachute. Splintering down a burning tree. My confidence is leaving me. And I don't have a parachute. I've got to let go. It might be the last fall. I'm heading for. The moment of truth calling out now. The moment of truth is stripping me down. Moment of truth calling out now. And the clock ticks on. Looking down the precipice. A lover's touch brought me to this. And I don't have a substitute. Rocks are breaking off below. I feel I'm losing my foothold. And I don't have a substitute. I've got to let go. But it might be one more lie. I'm falling for. The moment of truth calling out now. The moment of truth is stripping me down. Moment of truth calling out now. And the clock ticks on. And the time is now. And the light shines on. And the light shines on. The moment of truth calling out now. Moment of truth. Calling out now. Calling out. Calling out...

There's no happy ending. When love goes to war. A heart needs defending. When love goes to war. There's no happy ending. When love goes to war. I don't want your sympathies. Just give me what I ask.

A magic day he passed my way. And while we spoke of many things. Fools and kings. This he said to me. The greatest thing. You'll ever learn. Is just to love. And be loved in return. .

Something I want you to know. I've told you this once before. Don't want you to see him no more. Once again. You've let me down. Broke my heart. And turned me round. There's a light in the darkness. It doesn't seem far. Is something the matter. ??? ajar. The plane goes down. Will not land. Pilot's dead. Nowhere to be found.
2460,Big Star,Rock,Love me again. Be my friend. I need you now. I'll show you somehow
2461,Big Star,Rock,I'd like to go to India. Live in a big white house in the forest. Drink gin and tonic and play a grand piano. Read a few books. Far from what saddens my heart. Try to live away from it. Find a new girl. Who says she feels the same. Get to know her after the trip. Bathe in a forest pool. Her life a part of mine. And let no one know until I'm gone.
2462,Big Star,Rock,There was a light. So dear to me. I wanted to live. There was a time. So near to me. I asked you to give your life to me. If it's a sign. Sent down to me. I'm asking you why. It had to be. Spending all my time. Waiting to die. What's the use. There was a light. So dear to me. I wanted to live. There was a time. So dear to me. I asked you to give your life to me.
2463,Big Star,Rock,When I look though your eyes. I tend to get bitter. Maybe I'm best advised. To look to myself. I fall every time. Though I know she lies. I can't stay away. Stars would fall from the sky. And I won't forsake you. You've got lust in your heart. What's sad to me. I'll use every line. Anything to make you mine. Keeping me in the dark. Wondering where you are. Don't let me fall apart. You said take it slow. But I don't know. I don't know. Lying awake in the bed trying to. Cope with the feelings. I'm don't know if it's love. But what can I do. I fall every time. Though I know she lies. I can't stay away.
2464,Big Star,Rock,Lord I've been trying to be what I should. Lord I've been trying to do what I could. But each time it gets a little harder. I feel the pain. But I'll try again.

2465,Big Star,Rock,She's a schemer and she makes me bad. but I love her a lot those lonely nights. I was in a big room playing my things. oh I wish she were here she can be so kind. when she's not trying to hide. she tries not to love me but she knows. she can. CHORUS And why don't you come on back from. way out west. and love me we can work out the rest. She thinks she's a mystery to all. but I know what's behind those eyes. sometimes I think she'll make me forget. what I need most to remember. and then I'll slip on back. even if they say it's better..
2466,Big Star,Rock,I liked her face and oh those eyes. she left today oh goodbye. and looking at you I'm drained outright. and isolated in the light. CHORUS And I resigned everyone. ever since I was young. I'm starting to understand. What's going ahn and how it's planned.

CHORUS You get what you deserve. you ought to find out what it's worth. and you've gotta have a lotta nerve.. You just do what pleases you. and go on and sign out every move. you're going to get place in the scene. all God's orphans get face in the dream.. Too bad such a drag ow !. so much pain down the drain. and a lot of us ain't got many friends..

2469,Billy Squier,Rock,Over and over--wanderin' through the years. Life is a diamond--love is a trail of tears. Sometimes I want you--sometimes I want to fly. I know when I find you. No one can stop me now--break you. Don't let me go--Don't let me. Watchin' the seasons--can't let you pass me by. Turnin' the pages--why do we have to lie. You are the reason--yours are the final eyes. And when I hold you. No one can touch me now--break-through. Don't let me go--Don't let me. Never wanna say goodbye--never wanna make you cry. Never wanna see you go. Now every time I close my eyes. You're the one who makes me realize. Don't let me go.
2470,Billy Squier,Rock,I get up--I run through the world like a fire. Heat it up--I swim in the flames of desire. Chase it if you care--take it if you dare--it's there in the air.... Answer to the gun--dance in the sun--run boy run.... Run for your life--you're movin' on and on. The art of survival is turnin' me on. . And I'll be chasin' it all night long (don'tcha wanna live). . I get out--I roam through the streets like a tiger. Let it out--I swing like a bird on a wire. Everywhere you go everybody knows--oh don'tcha know.... Everythin' you do--anybody new--they're all on to you.... Fight for your life--turn it all around. The art of survival isn't gettin' me down. . And I'll be chasin' it all night long (don'tcha wanna live).
2471,Billy Squier,Rock,"""The rich kids got the money. The rich kids play the stars. Walk around in fancy clothes. And drive them flashy cars. The rich girls get the jewelery. The rich boys get the girls. Playin' """"Mr. Romeo"""". They think they own the world. Breakdown you can lose control. They don't think nothin' of you. Not unless you're a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich like you. I ain't got no money - and I ain't got a home. I hang around the parking lot when all the cars are gone. I don't read the papers - the news is all the same. Tell you it's a rich man's world -. And you play the rich man's game. Come 'round to the judgement day there won't be nothin' for you. Not unless you're a rich kid too. You're a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich like you. Don't care what price I pay. I ain't got nothin' to lose.

2472,Billy Squier,Rock,From over the air comes a voice without care. Says we're doin' all right. But day out and day in from what he's been sayin'. We're in for a fight. I glance at myself and the world rushin' by. I can see for myself and the fear comes alive. Shades of termination--we're dyin' to survive. . 1984. Machine is the mind--it will rule by design. So you're never alone. We store information without confirmation. Accept the unknown. I think to myself of the times we have tried. To be true to ourselves and to live with the lie. Avoid the contradictions--just keep yourself alive. . 1984. I can't help it...I can't help it...I can't help it.... Life is your decision--we choose to do or die. Can you live with the reality of 1985. . Polite conversation ain't no consolation. For blanks in your eyes. Amidst the confusion there lives the illusion. That love will survive. But I got a chance with myself if I try. To be sure of myself and myself choose to try. Fight for stimulation and love to stay alive. . 1984.
2473,Billy Squier,Rock,Find yourself in the middle of the night. With a stranger in the darkness--somethin' don't seem right. Ask yourself 'whatever does it mean?'. You feel you don't belong here--still you're drawn into the scene. Take yourself to the middle of a dream. In a foreign situation nothin's really what it seems. You're not alone--through the static in your mind. There's a long-distance lover on your night-line. From outa nowhere you meet a man--says 'the time is right'. You never knew him--you can't get to him. But when ya do--you'll see the light. I put a spell on you. I'll look you up--I'll break you down. I put a spell on you. Time goes on--like a soldier in the rain. Now you've been around the world and now you're goin' back again. Tell yourself that there's somethin' more to gain. When you step into the fire you can never be the same. I see you movin'--you can't go home and you don't know why. You look for somethin'--you feel that somethin'. Will pull ya through--now wrong or right. I put a spell on you. I watch you walk--you won't get far. I put a spell on you. It keeps you movin'--what will you do when your time is right. You take that somethin'--I'll give ya somethin'. Don'tcha know--I think you might. I put a spell on you.

2476,Billy Squier,Rock,I saw you last night...alone in your dreams. You were so peaceful there...or that's how it seemed. But something is wrong...you feel it inside. No one can reach you there...but still you can't hide. 'Cause dreams never lie. You can't if you try. It's not often easy to wake up...sometimes. Don't say good-bye...don't say it's over. Don't say good-bye to the dreams of our love. Don't say good-bye...keep dreamin' for us. A shot in the dark...like ships in the night. So we're both older now...well that's all right. 'Cause visions live on where memories have died. We've walked that road before...we'll get there this time. Now I know you tried. You tell me that you've had enough. You think it might be easier to just give up. Don't say good-bye...don't say it's over. Don't say good-bye to the dreams of our love. Don't say good-bye...lean on my shoulder. Don't say good-bye...keep dreamin' for us. Tell ya baby...I can't stop thinkin'. 'Bout all those times you walked on out my door. Now I don't want you...say I don't need it. But I'll never--no never...let you go. Don't say good-bye...and don't look back. Don't say good-bye to the dreams of our love. Don't look back...and don't say why.

2478,Billy Squier,Rock,Turn through the pages back in your life. The world in changes got you under the knife. It don't turn easy...no matter what you say. You go 'round crazy...you throw it all away. Lost in action...torn and tired. Cool talkin' when your face is on fire. Scarred romances...cast away. Rollin' stoned...don't turn away. Break the silence. Send a message...a message of love. Lost through the ages back in your mind. You know what's yours...can you tell me what's mine. Old man trouble come knockin' at your door. He run you in circles...throw you down on the floor. Crimes of passion...paranoid. Showdown...now it's search and destroy. Close relations...bound and gagged. Share the news...don't turn away. Break the silence. Send a message...a message of love. Heads and shoulders...ball and chain. Don't charge me when I try to explain. Reputations...modern jivers. Gentle souls...all break the silence. Break the silence. Send a message...a message of love.

I feel the beat poundin'. You make me weak...you trip me up. I feel my heart boundin'. Make it so hard on me. Make me too blind to see. Turn on your light...make it so right. Don't leave me lonely...I get so lonely. . Say I can't get next to you. Doesn't matter --what I do. You won't deliver and I can't get through. No I can't get next to you. .

Gimme one night...make it so right. Don't leave me lonely...I get so lonely.
2481,Billy Squier,Rock,Freedom rider...though you've tried. Words are not enough for you now.... It's hard on your pride. I can't find you...though I know you. You are just a step out of line.... Come closer to me. When the lines are drawn. And no one comes to break us down. And the walls that stood between us. Tumble to the ground. It's time to find someone to run to. I've got a place in mind. It's known as conscience point. It's where the clouds roll by. They say that nothin' really matters. I'm goin' out to find. Why people come this way. And put the past behind. You know there really is a reason. Changing faces...trading places. Nothing lasts anymore...it's hard when you try. Star-crossed lovers run for cover. I don't know if it's right...but I know how I feel. When you're tired of all those things. You never said before. And although you've tried you never opened that door. It's time to find someone to run to. We'll run the roads tonite. We'll meet at conscience point. I look into your eyes. You say that nothin' really matters. If I could change your mind. If you would look my way. And leave it all behind. You'd know you really mean so much to me. When you've tired of all those things. You've never done before. And you never took the time. To fall in love before. You've got to find someone to...yea. We'll run the roads tonite. We'll meet at conscience point. I'll look into your eyes. And know that somethin' really matters. 'Cause we can change our minds. And we can find our way. And leave it all behind. 'Cause you really mean that much to me. Conscience point...take a walk with me. And put it all behind. We'll make some history.

2483,Billy Squier,Rock,You can't get up--you can't get down. You can't sit still--you never settle down. Don't say you love me--just say--'huh'!. You love runs hot--your love runs cold. You can't get loose until you get control. Don't say you love me--just say--'huh'!. Don't say you love me--just say--'all right'. You're scared to win--you're scared to lose. You're scared to live with the life you choose. Don't say you love me--just say--. You can't say 'yes'--you can't say 'no'. Your mind's made up--you don't know where to go. Don't say you love me--whatcha say?. Don't say you love me--just say--'huh'!. I can see you comin' round again. I can feel you but I can't say when. I will be there in your now and then.
2484,Billy Squier,Rock,Bend your back by the light o' the sun. You come to the business--you're the number one. When twilight comes you're a runner in the night. It turns you on like a hot tail-light. Get down--you really get down--you never let down. Come down--you never come down--you never come down. . Emotions in motion. . Back street boy gonna sell you some sin. He'll wind you up--he gonna suck you in. The blood say yes--the mind say no. The voice in your ear say you go - go - go. Run down--you really run down--you really run down. Cool down--you never cool down--you better cool down. . Emotions in motion. . Give yourself to a life of extremes. You're into the action--it's a part of your dream. Now there're some things you never can tell. But when the door lies open throw your coins in the well. Get down--you really get down--you really get down. Right now--you want it right now--hold tight now. . Emotions in motion. .
2485,Billy Squier,Rock,I watch you on the tv--you're with me every place I go. I'm caught up in the daydream--I'm into everyone you know. Turn on the action--grab every minute. Learn every lesson--then live to regret it. I'm so distracted--my mind's disengaged. Sharin' the moments when you're all the rage. . I got my eyes on you. Got my eye on you.... Those overnight conditions always get the best of you. You're fuelin' my suspicions--I'm taken by the sneak preview. You got the numbers--you got no limits. One day you're out but the next day you're in it. You find the answers--you know what to say. Give us our reasons for livin' today. . I got my eyes on you. Got my eye on you.... We share the laughter and pain when you're in it. Bring on disaster--cause we know you'll win it. We're all believers--so watch what you say. Turn on those feelin's...I can't look away. . I got my eyes on you. Got my eye on you.
2486,Billy Squier,Rock,These are the golden years. When people get what they want. And you can be one of them. 'Cause you're old enough to burn. So you earn your star--you run from the pack. Sell the clothes from off of your back. And you'll go far--you'll never look back. Your dreams can never die. Welcome to the facts of life. Life on the edge of town.... No one could get near you. But one day you call to them. When they find you where it hurts. You can fall so far you never come up. All you've got is never enough. And just one word can make it so tough. Your dreams were not so wise.... You're runnin' through the facts of life. Oh you're runnin' from the facts of life. Oh you're runnin' from the facts of life. Oh you're runnin' from the facts of life. Oh you're runnin' from the facts of life. The first time I saw you. You were untouchable. You walked on the poet's heels. No one could deny you. Now you're lookin' for better things. Someone to get close to. A song everybody knows. ...When you find out what it's worth.... And you come so far you'll never turn back. The stones they throw--they roll off your back. They make it hard--you like it like that. Your dreams will never die. When you go so far you'll never turn back. The stones they throw--you throw 'em right back. They play so hard--you like it like that. Our dreams become our lives. No more runnin' from the facts of life. No more runnin' from the facts of life. No more runnin' from the facts of life. No more runnin'.... No more runnin'.... No more runnin' from the facts of life.
2487,Billy Squier,Rock,"""You know sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night.... And I get to thinkin' about all the crazy things we do in life just to get by.... And somehow somethin' always seems to escape me.... And I find myself holdin' on to nothin' more than a dream.... And it keeps hauntin' me...over and over and over again.... . In a darkened sky of blue I'm thinkin' of you.... As the pieces come unglued I'm reachin' for you.... Love can change the days in your life. Heartbeats and whispers in the dead of night. The sound of a hand--the touch of an eye. Visions are callin' that you can't deny. . And I fall for love.... So every day I'm out on the streets tryin' to make some sense of it.... You know sometimes it feels so close that I can almost reach out.... But it always slips away.... I keep tellin' myself...""""I can't stop tryin'...not ever"""".... . 'Til I see that dream come true baby with you.... If it's the final thing I do I'm waitin' for you.... Loneliness and love will collide. The body's breakin' but the spirit's alive. And just when you think it's all been a lie. Visions are callin' and you never can deny. . And I fall for love.... ...I'm gonna keep on tryin'...."""
2488,Billy Squier,Rock,LOVE...it's that one big step you take. EYES...watchin' every move you make. When the fear lifts you up...you won't back down. ...Be careful what you say. Beware of the dark...they'll steal your heart away. It's illogical...psychological.... It can change your world--make it all work out. ...So illogical.... Hands of seduction...hands of seduction. Hands of seduction...workin' workin' overtime. ...Hands of seduction. Crimes of the heart are hard to take. Lies can't defend your first mistake. When you're vulnerable...it's improbable. You can face your world--make it all work out. ...You're so vulnerable.... Hands of seduction...creepy fingers through your mind. Hands of seduction.... Hands of seduction...workin' workin' overtime.... Hands of seduction. It's illogical...psychological.... It can change your world--make it all work out. ...It's illogical. Hands of seduction...know the secrets in your mind. Hands of seduction.... Hands of seduction...workin' workin' overtime.... Hands of seduction.... So you say you owe the sands of time. If you don't look now your life won't lie. Jack and Jill conquered the hill.... But even still they had to pay the bill. For their father's sins. Like a poor boy...(say) you just can't win. In the hands of the devil there's double trouble. You got it comin'...no use in runnin'. Said I've always known there's a price you pay.... Like when I see you babe. I wanna take you all the way...all the way.... To a place you've never known. Beyond your heart...beyond a home.... Way beyond your shame... Your hands seduce me.
2489,Billy Squier,Rock,I can't stop...it always gets the best of me. I can't stop...been holdin' out so long. I can't stop...whenever you get close to me. I can't stop...I'm really not that strong. I don't wanna grow apart. I don't wanna drift away. I don't wanna come apart. We can surely find a way. Now I don't mind...lookin' at the photographs. I find myself...holdin' back the tears. And I don't mind...when I read the words you wrote to me. 'Cause I got time...to silence all my fears. I don't want us torn apart. I don't wanna slip away. I don't want us torn apart. Give me just another day. I don't wanna throw it all away. I don't wanna lose my hold. I don't wanna throw it all away. I don't wanna lose my...whoa.... I can't stop...I'm holdin' back the memories. But Hercules...is not my middle name. Walls will fall...and you'll be standin' next to me. And Hercules...will never be the same. I don't wanna fall apart. I don't wanna fade away. I don't wanna fall apart. Give me just another day. I don't wanna throw it all away. I don't wanna throw it all away. I don't wanna throw it all away. I don't wanna throw it all away...all away.
2490,Billy Squier,Rock,Early in the mornin' I'm layin' on my bed. Stickin' to the rhythm of the music in my head. Rockin' in the mirror...rollin' out the door. Hop into the car and put the pedal to the floor. Callin' out your number--I'll take you for a ride. Find something to keep me satisfied. . Runnin' for the money...layin' out the green. It's a tax accountant's nightmare--it's a rock 'n roll dream. The income may be different but the outcome's still the same. You'll never be a winner boy until you play the game. Hounded to distraction...racin' to and fro. Losin' my direction keepin' up my status quo. Now I tried - tried - tried - tried. It just don't seem to keep me satisfied. . A hundred-thousand miles in a 747. Take it all in style if you wanna get to heaven. Chasin' all the action every single night. Never understand it but you try to do it right. Ragged 'round the edges...none the worse for wear. Cuttin' all the corners but they never get me there. Now I try - try - try - try. It just don't seem to keep me satisfied. .
2491,Billy Squier,Rock,There is a course in life...so all the teachers say. It calls you day and night...it takes your thoughts away. Under a frozen light you face a long crusade. Where there's a cause you fight...where there's a cost you pay. Find an empty heart...you feel the passion play. It's when reactions start that you can't look away. There is no wrong or right--there's just your point of view. But when you face the light then it will come to you. Love is the hero...soldier forever. Life below zero...never say never. There is no sacrifice...there is no dead-end street. There is no sound advice...only the watch you keep. With every step you take through every room of fear. With every move you make the song will pull you near. Turn you world around and it will come your way. Through your cold-chill nights and in your hard-earned days. When you face the light it may be hard to do. But when it's all too right then it will come to you. Love is the hero...soldier forever. Love is the hero...you live to remember. No path is too steep...no distance too wide. No question too deep...no force can divide. You fortune you seek...the road will unwind. You're comin' to me...to search is to find. And when you start to fall into that frozen space. And when you reach the wall and there's no sunny place. And when it all comes down you make it anyhow...anyway. Love is the hero....
2492,Billy Squier,Rock,I was green in my younger days. Full of plans but not much knowin'. Tried my hand at the game of love. But I was so naive. From the shelter of mama's wings. Learned to fly but I was broken. By a woman of 25. When I was just 19. Didn't know where to find myself. The rules they were not so simple. Makes no sense tryin' to face this world. 'Til you're old enough to fight. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. Lover...never thought that I would see the light. I was hungry in '81. For a time I thought I'd found her. Found myself on the road again. Freezin' from the cold. Fortune found me in '82. With a girl from way down under. She seemed like the natural thing. I thought I knew for sure. Tried to hold her--I could not see. Past her eyes was a spell unbroken. Battered visions and frozen dreams. That would never see the light...now you're my. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. Lover...someone told me it comes once-in-a-lifetime. Lover...never thought that I would see the light. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. It's a long road to salvation. People say nothin' lasts forever. But when it comes to the bottom line. When I make it I'll see you there...see you there. Once in a lifetime.... Now we're lookin' on better times. It seems like a miracle. But I'll never forget those days. I'm ready now to fight...for you my. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. Lover...someone told me it comes once-in-a-lifetime. Lover...never thought that I would see the light. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. Once in a lifetime....
2493,Billy Squier,Rock,I saw you for the first time yesterday. You looked at me but somethin' wasn't right. A face I thought I'd come to know by heart. Now hidden by a mask with no reveal. Just when I thought I knew you. I can feel no pulse inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you stripped my senses clean. I can feel no pulse...there's just your mind-machine. You say that you got feelin's just like me. You prove it as you throw me out the door. I'm reelin' from your sensitivity. Is this the shape of better things to come. I'm frightened for the future. I can feel no pulse inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you stripped my senses clean. I can feel no pulse...inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you broke my mind-machine. Inside your world it's cold and blue as ice. Where no one speaks and no one need reply. To questions that I've asked a thousand times. No answer to the riddles that you keep. It must be hard to be you. I can feel no pulse inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you stripped my senses clean. I can feel no pulse...inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you broke my mind-machine.
2494,Billy Squier,Rock,I may get around...I may laugh alot.... Now you'd think that I'd be happy with the life I got. Nobody knows...nobody sees. Ain't nobody really knows the inner side o'me.... I may seem secure...I could have it made.... You might think you see a lucky man who made the grade. Nobody knows what dreams I see. Ain't nobody really sure just who they wanna be.... But everybody has a place and time.... A chance to live...a need to find. We all got somethin' that we care about. I propose you find it out.... It's not in a book...or a magazine.... Or the stars who guide our fortunes on the silver screen. Nobody knows...it's up to me. Ain't nobody who can say it like it outght to be.... I see my future at the rainbow's end. Happy hours...timeless friends. And if I ever chance to find my way. Rest assured...I will stay.... You may see your life as a compromise. You may live to find the promise dancin' in your eyes. Nobody knows...it's meant to be.... Let the magic of the moment say it all to me. (Dedicated to the life of John Lennon).
2495,Billy Squier,Rock,Hey brother the sky is fallin'. Hey brother it all comes down. Soul-searchin' amongst the ashes. There must be some way out of this old town. Sin-sister don't curse your neighbor. No tellin' (when) she might be you. Sin-sister you're not the only. Lonely girl who's left with nothin' to lose. Saw my future in yesterday. Someone told me it won't be long. Turned my future in yesterday. Think it's time that we move on. Love's not a color...what does it matter to you. Love's not a color...what would ya do if I were you would ya do it. Hey brother your streets are burnin'. Loose talkin' and the work's all gone. Say brother we best be learnin'. Don't make it right doin' somebody wrong. Soul sister I feel your sadness. Soul sister it hurts me too. Soul sister I can't stop thinkin'. We got to make some peace between me and you. Heaven knows--not an easy thing. It's not somethin' we laugh about. Heaven knows--not an easy thing. Take my hand got to hold on. Love's not a color...what does it matter to you. Love's not a color...what would ya do if I were you would ya do it. Not a color...what does it matter to you. Love's not a color.... Open your eyes to the sky and the mountains. Learn how to fly--I can take you anywhere. Lift your voice through the sounds of silence. Yea...yea...yea. Not a color...does it matter to you. Not a color...does it matter to you.
2496,Billy Squier,Rock,"""The rich kids got the money. The rich kids play the stars. Walk around in fancy clothes. And drive them flashy cars. The rich girls get the jewelery. The rich boys get the girls. Playin' """"Mr. Romeo"""". They think they own the world. Breakdown you can lose control. They don't think nothin' of you. Not unless you're a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich like you. I ain't got no money - and I ain't got a home. I hang around the parking lot when all the cars are gone. I don't read the papers - the news is all the same. Tell you it's a rich man's world -. And you play the rich man's game. Come 'round to the judgement day there won't be nothin' for you. Not unless you're a rich kid too. You're a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich like you. Don't care what price I pay. I ain't got nothin' to lose. I wanna be rich like you. I won't be shot down when I get my way. I won't be comin' to you. Cause I'll be a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich kid too. Rich kid - I wanna be a rich like you..."""
2497,Billy Squier,Rock,And so the knife comes down...another curtain falls. And no one hears the sound...and no one takes the call. From me and my anxiety...locked up in these four walls. I come to you now I'm alone...with my defenses down. I tell you everything I need...I get down on the ground. I always know that when I go...that I'll be back again. Shocked straight--doctor can you get my medicine. Shocked straight--doctor can't you see the shape I'm in. Shocked straight--doctor when you gonna let me in. If I could listen to my mind...and keep the world outside my door.... But time has opened up my eyes and shown me somethin' more. Now all I want is to be free...and get up off the floor. Why can't you look into my heart.... Why can't you ever let me know. You're always takin' me apart...you're never lettin' go. There's always somethin' on your mind.... This ain't reality. Shocked straight--doctor can you get my medicine. Shocked straight--doctor can't you see the shape I'm in. Shocked straight--doctor when you gonna let me in. Why you be so hard. Why you be so hard. Why you be so hard. I know it's gonna take some time...for me to straighten out my head. To say what's on my mind...to hear those words I said. And while I'm tryin' to learn to feel.... You keep on tellin' me.... Shocked straight--doctor can you get my medicine. Shocked straight--doctor can't you see the shape I'm in. Shocked straight--doctor when you gonna let me in. Shocked straight.... Shocked straight.... Shocked straight...when you gonna let me in. Why you be so hard. Why you be so hard. Why you be so hard.
2498,Billy Squier,Rock,Ah satisfaction...when you gonna show. Dyin' for some action...dontcha wanna go. Down to the mainline...betcha gonna crawl. Dance across the table...drink until you fall. When you feel it you gotta move. When you steal it you found the groove. Take me higher still it's not enough. One more desire to get me off. Shot o' love.... Steppin' out from undercover...we'll be oilin' up the fire. Gonna blow up your street...we go down to the wire. The scent is gonna lead you blind. Never know what you're sure to find. Gets you higher still it's not enough. One more desire to get me off. Shot o' love. When you step into the engine-room. Feel the system when it's all in tune. You push the power still it's not enough. Hands on a vision--gotta hang tough baby. The music gonna set you free. Roll it over when you turn the key. Come on baby--shoot me blind. Gimme everything...everything...lemme know you're mine. Shot o' love.
2499,Billy Squier,Rock,What's that sound...this poundin' in my head. The beat's so loud...got me tossin' in my bed. I been avoidin' it for too long. I can love 'em and leave 'em.... Then I can't go wrong. But that kinda love don't get you too far. ...Leaves you out by back door. It's a strange strange fire.... Burns me when I'm touchin' you. It's a strange strange fire.... It's a strange strange fire.... What's that sound...this ringin' in my ears. The beat keeps poundin' (turn it up). Now my time is drawin' near. Gotta get on with this emotion. Got my back to the wall.... Your devotion makes me.... Cry like a baby...and now I can't let go. It's a strange strange fire.... Burns me when I'm touchin' you. It's a strange strange fire.... It's a strange strange fire.... Standin' on the edge of.... Such a strange strange fire. I been watchin' you.... I found out where you sleep.... I hear the names you call.... And the company you keep.... It's an endless fight.... For an endless love.... Now I'm reachin' down inside.... Gonna find out what I want. It's a strange strange fire.... Burns me when I'm touchin' you. It's a strange strange fire.... It's a strange strange fire.... Standin' on the edge of.... Such a strange strange fire. It's a strange strange fire. It's a strange strange fire. It's a strange strange fire.... Burn me baby. It's a strange strange fire....
2500,Billy Squier,Rock,Destiny's a road we ride. Sight unseen--our thoughts untried. Through the years--a million miles. A trial of errors--a life of trials. There's a sign along the highway. There's a candle by my bed. There's a face in the doorway. There's a price on my head. . Sweet release...come in peace. Sweet release...won't you carry me on. Sweet release...my falls increase. Sweet release...I'm not that strong. . Sex machine will break you down. Strip you clean and take your crown. Wasted nights--rise and fall. One-way lights--they hide it all. Now I stand before the mirror. Hold the candle to my face. I can feel the scars burnin'. But they don't leave a trace. . Sweet release...rest in peace. Sweet release...I toss and turn. Sweet release...come and teach me. Sweet release...we never learn. . Black and white is black and red. None are right--but some are dead. Through every life the war drags on. Our hopes and dreams lie ripped and torn. . Sweet release...give us peace. Sweet release...won't you carry me on. Sweet release...will it never cease. Sweet release...can't you see I'm not that strong.
2501,Billy Squier,Rock,I got the big beat. I hear the sound. I got the big beat. I get on down. I hear the big beat. All through the town. I got the big beat. I get around. There's no time for hesitation. We got all we need to know. Don't deny the situation. Find it everywhere you go. Life it's the big beat. Roll to the sound. I got the big beat. Oh gather 'round. I got the big beat. Down in my shoes. I got the big beat. I'm gonna give it to you. It's the line of fascination. It's the rage both near and far. Synchronize a generation - yeah. It don't matter who you are - oh yeah. I got the big beat. I'll show you how. I got the big beat. You got it now - oh yeah
2502,Billy Squier,Rock,It's not over til it's over...it's not over til the end. It's not over til it's over...so we struggle to pretend. Hesitation makes you over...we all walk in our own way. Shadows deepen when it's over...through the summer of longer days. Cast in the call of a million smiles blown away. Everytime you fall it's a thousand times torn away. Castles built to fall with the sands of time wash away. No escapin' til it's over...friends will say it's not the same. Memories falter when it's over...some are lost and some remain. Someone take me when it's over...set a lantern by the door. Can't forget you...but I can't hold on...toss the anchor from off the shore. Cast in the call of a million smiles blown away. Everytime you fall it's a thousand times torn away. Castles built to fall with the sands of time wash away. Castles built to fall with the sands of time wash away. ...Will the moment come again. I still love you when it's over...I still want you to come again.
2503,Billy Squier,Rock,So you're out to change the world. You can do it none too fast. You don't want to see your future. Wash away into the past. Now a change is gonna come.... Say it's written on the streets. But there's a monkey on your back. ...Try to put him on a shelf. And you try to find in others. What you hide inside yourself. And you worry 'bout the war. And you try to understand. But forget about tomorrow. When you're playin' in the band. Stay young at heart. Stay young at heart. Now you've been around the world. Seen the shape of things to come. You begin to feel the damage. From the crazy things we've done. Now the lines are overdrawn. ...See 'em bleedin' down your face. And there's a sore and scary monster.... She's-a comin' after you. Stay young at heart. Stay young at heart. You can't be too wise. So open your eyes. Stay young at heart...yea. Now you're weary from the war. But it's time to start again. And you don't know what you're fightin' for. But you'll fight until the end. Now forget about the future. Don'tcha try to understand. There's no need to fear tomorrow. Just keep playin' in the band. Stay young at heart. Stay young at heart. You can't be too wise. So open your eyes. Stay young...stay young. Stay young at heart.
2504,Black Ties,Rock,I was young. But you... you were as young as I was. We use to sing the songs. But now we stand for nothing. And we stopped making love. We kept growing up and now we have nothing at all. Time give me time and maybe I'll give something to you. Cause neither all the stars and the rhymes. Can keep us from falling. What can I say I might look okay but you took it too much. And what can I play when there is nothing to say you broke me heart. And we stopped wondering we kept furthering and now we have nothing at all
2505,Blitz,Pop,Sabe essas noites que você sai caminhando sozinho. De madrugada com a mão no bolso. Na rua. E você fica pensando naquela menina. Você fica torcendo e querendo que ela tivesse. Na sua. Aí finalmente você encontra o broto. Que felicidade (que felicidade). Que felicidade (que felicidade). Você convida ela pra sentar (muito obrigada). Garçom uma cerveja (Só tem chope). Desce dois desce mais. Amor pede uma porção de batata frita. OK você venceu batata frita. Ai blá blá blá blá blá blá blá blá blá. Ti ti ti ti ti ti ti ti ti. Você diz pra ela. Tá tudo muito bom (bom). Tá tudo muito bem (bem). Mas realmente. Mas realmente. Eu preferia que você estivesse. Nuuuuu...a. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Todo mundo dizia. Que a gente se parecia. Cheio de tal coisa e coisa e tal. E realmente a gente era. A gente era um casal. Um casal sensacional. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. No começo tudo era lindo. Era tudo divino era maravilhoso. Até debaixo d'água nosso amor era mais gostoso. Mas de repente a gente enlouqueceu. Ai eu dizia que era ela. Ela dizia que era eu. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Amor que que'cê tem. Cê ta tão nervoso. Nada nada nada nada nada nada. Foi besteira usar essa tática. Dessa maneira assim dramática (eu tava nervoso). O nosso amor era uma orquestra sinfônica (eu sei). E o nosso beijo uma bomba atômica. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. Você não soube me amar. É foi isso que ela me disse. Oh! baby não!
2506,Blitz,Pop,Perdi meu amor. No paraíso. Dou tudo que eu tenho. Por um aviso. . Ou Seja sob sol. Ou debaixo de chuva. A Minha alma geme por você. Geme geme uh! uh!. Por você. Geme geme ah!. Por você. Geme geme uh! uh!. Por você. Geme geme ah!. Não durmo de noite. Arrasto correntes. Sozinho na cama. Trincando os dentes. Seja sob sol. Ou debaixo de chuva. Minha alma geme por você. Geme geme uh! uh!. Por você. Geme geme ah!. Por você. Geme geme uh! uh!. Por você. Geme geme ah!. Vocês podem estar pensando. Ela foi embora. Mas está quase voltando. Não demora. Ou ela foi pra muito longe. Felicidade. Onde estás que não respondes. Seja sob sol. Ou debaixo de chuva. Minha alma geme por você. Geme geme uh! uh!. Por você. Geme geme ah!. Por você. Geme geme uh! uh!. Por você. Geme geme ah!

2529,Blondie,Rock,Some days are all Mondays.. Sort of time on ice.. It seems like jet planes on snowed in runways under clear blue skies.. Who needs it?. Nothing is real but the girl.. Nothing is real but her.. Money goes to money in a figure eight around me.. Money.. Who's gonna love me if I liquidate and drown me?. Nothing is real but the girl.. Nothing else feels solid.. We believe in love.. We believe in little things like Heaven up above and seven.. It's a lucky number!. We believe that something lives inside every thing there is.. Don't think about it much.. I mean it.. I believe it.. I believe it.. Wind down.. Put your mind down like your missing school.. You'll teach her to find out while your dying in your living room how much you need her.. Nothing is real but the girl.. Only her eyes are solid.. Nothing is real but her.. Nothing is real but the girl..
2530,Blondie,Rock,The song is called Rules of Living:). Here's the lyrics. Im another life. When the gods were crazy. And the measurement of time. Were the ending seasons. And maybe we believed. There was anger in the storm. Sometimes the Sky reminds me. And if you think that's wild. There's my dream of Egypt. And the colour of the Nile. You're a Roman Soilder. It's small world after all. But's older than you think. Sometimes your eyes remind me. Don't know why. I'll wait a lifetme till you find me. There are times. mmmm I've been this way before. mmmm I'll come this way again. So many things remind me. So many things inside. Sometimes your eyes remind me. Don't know why. I'll wait a lifetme till you find me. There are times. mmmm I've been this way before. mmmm I'll come this way again. So many things remind me. So many things inside. In another life. when the gods were crazy. And complaining all the time. And the people look at me. The volocano wants a bribe. And I'm still afraid of fire. mmmm I've been this way before. mmmm I'll come this way again. So many things remind me. So many things inside. mmmm I've been this way before. mmmm I'll come this way again. So many things remind me. So many things inside.
2531,Blondie,Rock,It can't be. You stole the keys from me. You locked me inside my rumor gloom. It's too dark to think that I love you. I think love you too much. I love you to the much. Got to go. Cause now i'm living standardized. And I've been living. Got to leave what i've been giving you. Without your love. Got to go. Cause now i'm living standardized. And I've been living. Got to leave what i've been giving you. Without your love. I'm not free. I can hardly breath. You locked me outside my heart. It's too dark to think that I love you. I think I love you too much. I love you to the much. Got to go. Cause now i'm living standardized. And I've been living. Got to leave what i've been giving you. Without your love. Got to go. Cause now i'm living standardized. And I've been living. Got to leave what i've been giving you. Without your love. You want me to be nothing. You want me to be nothing. Without you. I love you to the muc
2532,Blondie,Rock,I wrote this song for someone else to sing. To see what a meeting of the minds might bring. But we're not exactly two of a kind. And our meeting has come to a grind. Words in my mouth. Thoughts in my head. Don't put your words in my mouth. That's not what I meant. Got an appetite for seduction. Muzzleloader and chewing gum. We're on opposite sides of a line.

2533,Bob Dylan,Rock,How many roads must a man walk down. Before you call him a man?. How many seas must a white dove sail. Before she sleeps in the sand?.

They'll stone you when you're there all alone. But I would not feel so all alone. Everybody must get stoned. They'll stone you when you're walking on the street. They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat. They'll stone you when your walking on the floor. They'll stone you when your walking to the door. But I would not feel so all alone. Everybody must get stoned. They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table. They'll stone you when you are young and able. They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck. They'll stone you and then they'll say good luck. But I would not feel so all alone. Everybody must get stoned. Well They'll stone you and say that it's the end. They'll stone you and then they'll come back again. They'll stone you when you're riding in your car. They'll stone you when you're playing you guitar. Yes But I would not feel so all alone. Everybody must get stoned. Alright. Well They'll stone you when you are all alone. They'll stone you when you are walking home. They'll stone you and then say they're all brave.

2535,Bob Dylan,Rock,Come you masters of war. You that build the big guns. You that build the death planes. You that build all the bombs. You that hide behind walls. You that hide behind desks. I just don't want you to know. I can see through your masks. You that never done nothin'. But build to destroy. You play with my world. Like it's your little toy. You put a gun in my hand. And you hide from my eyes. And you turn and run farther. When the fast bullets fly. Like Judas of old. You lie and deceive. A world war can be won. You want me to believe. But I see through your eyes. And I see through your brain. Like I see through the water. That runs down my drain. You fasten all the triggers. For the others to fire. Then you set back and watch. When the death count gets higher. You hide in your mansion. As young people's blood. Flows out of their bodies. And is buried in the mud. You've thrown the worst fear. That can ever be hurled. Fear to bring children. Into the world. For threatening my baby. Unborn and unnamed. You ain't worth the blood. That runs in your veins. How much do I know. To talk out of turn. You might say that I'm young. You might say I'm unlearned. But there's one thing I know. Though I'm younger than you. Even Jesus would never. Forgive what you do. Let me ask you one question. Is your money that good. Will it buy you forgiveness. Do you think that it could. I think you will find. When your death takes its toll. All the money you made. Will never buy back your soul. And I hope that you die. And your death'll come soon. I will follow your casket. In the pale afternoon. And I'll watch while you're lowered. Down to your deathbed. And I'll stand o'er your grave. 'Til I'm sure that you're dead

2540,Bob Dylan,Rock,Hollis Brown. He lived on the outside of town. Hollis Brown. He lived on the outside of town. With his wife and five children. And his cabin fallin' down. You looked for work and money. And you walked a rugged mile. You looked for work and money. And you walked a rugged mile. Your children are so hungry. That they don't know how to smile. Your baby's eyes look crazy. They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve. Your baby's eyes look crazy. They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve. You walk the floor and wonder why. With every breath you breathe. The rats have got your flour. Bad blood it got your mare. The rats have got your flour. Bad blood it got your mare. If there's anyone that knows. Is there anyone that cares?. You prayed to the Lord above. Oh please send you a friend. You prayed to the Lord above. Oh please send you a friend. Your empty pockets tell yuh. That you ain't a-got no friend. Your babies are crying louder. It's pounding on your brain. Your babies are crying louder now. It's pounding on your brain. Your wife's screams are stabbin' you. T.ike the dirty drivin' rain. Your grass it is turning black. There's no water in your well. Your grass is turning black. There's no water in your well. You spent your last lone dollar. On seven shotgun shells.

And your legs can't seem to stand. Your brain is a-bleedin'. And your legs can't seem to stand. Your eyes fix on the shotgun. That you're holdin' in your hand. There's seven breezes a-blowin'. All around the cabin door. There's seven breezes a-blowin'. All around the cabin door. Seven shots ring out. Like the ocean's pounding roar. There's seven people dead. On a South Dakota farm. There's seven people dead. On a South Dakota farm. Somewhere in the distance. There's seven new people born.

2545,Bob Dylan,Rock,Come all ye fair and tender ladies. Be careful how you court young men. They're like a star on a summer's morning. They'll first appear and then they're gone. They'll tell you some loving story. They'll declare to you their love is true. Then they will go and court some other. And that's the love they have for you. Do you remember our days of courting. When your head lay upon my breast. You could make me believe with falling of your arm. That the sun rose in the west. I wish I was a little sparrow. And I had wings with which to fly. Right over to see my false true-lover. And when he's talking I'd be nigh. But I'm not a little sparrow. I have no wings with which to fly. So I sit here in grief and sorrow. To weep and pass my troubles by. If I had known before I courted. That love was such a killing thing. I'd a-locked my heart in a box of golden. And fastened it up with a silver pin
2546,Bob Dylan,Rock,I cross the Green Mountain. I sit by the stream. Heaven blazing in my head I. I dreamt a monsterous dream. Something came up. Out of the sea. Swept through the land of. The rich and the free. I look into the eyes. of my merciful friend. And then I ask myself. Is this the end?. Memories linger. Sad yet sweet. And I think of the souls in heaven who will be. Alters are burning. The flames far and wide. the fool has crossed over. from the other side. They tip their caps. from the top of the hill. You can feel them come. All brave blood do spill. Along the dim. Atlantic line. The rapper's land. lasts for miles behind. the lights coming foreward. and the streets are broad. all must yield. To the avenging God. The world is old. The world is great. Lessons of life. Can't be learned in a day. I watch and I wait. And I listen while I stand. To the music that comes. from a far better land. Close the eyes. of our Captain. Peace may he know. His long night is done. The great leader is laid low. He was ready to fall. He was quick to defend. Killed outright he was. by his own men. It's the last day's last hour. of the last happy year. I feel that the unknown. The world is so dear. Pride will vanish. And glory will rot. But virtue lives. and cannot be forgot. The bells. of evening have rung. there's blasphemy. on the end of the tongue. Let them say that I walked. in fair nature's light. And that I was loyal. to truth and to right. Serve God and meet your full. Look upward beyond. Beyond the darkness that masks. the surprises of dawn. In the deep green grasses. and the blood stained woods. They never dreamed of surrendering. They fell where they stood. Stars fell over Alabama. And I saw each star. You're walking in dreams. Whoever you are. Chilled as the skies. Keen as the frost. And the ground's froze hard. And the morning is lost. A letter to mother. came today. Gunshot wound to the breast. is what it did say. But he'll be better soon. He's in a hospital bed. But he'll never be better. He's already dead. I'm ten miles outside the city. And I'm lifted away. In an ancient light. That is not of day. They were calm they were gloomed. We knew them all too well. We loved eachother more than. we ever dared to tell
2547,Bob Dylan,Rock,The light. In this place. Is really bad. Like being. In the bottom. Of a stream. Any minute now. I'm expecting. To wake up. From a dream. Miss so much. The softest touch. Like the grave. Of some child child. Who neither wept. Nor smiled. I'm hiding my faith. In the rain. I've been. Dreamin' of you. That's all I do. And it's. Driving me insane. Somewhere dawn. Is breaking. Light is streaking. Across the floor. Church bells. Are ringing. I wonder who. They're ringing for. Travel under any star. You'll see me. Wherever you are. The shadowy past. Is so vague and so vast. I'm sleeping. In the balance of pain. I've been dreamin' of you. That's all I do. But it's. Driving me insane. Maybe they'll get me. Maybe they won't. But whatever. It won't be tonight. I wish your hand. Was in mine right now. We could go. Where the moon is wide. For years. They had me. Locked in a cage. Then they threw me. Onto the stage. Somethings. Just last longer. Then you. Thought they would. And they never. Ever explain. I'm dreamin' of you. That's all I do. And it's. Driving me insane. Well. I eat when I'm hungry. Drink when I'm dry. Live my life. On the square. Even if the flesh. Falls off my face. It won't matter as long. As you're there. Feel like. A ghost in love. Underneath. The heavens above. Feel further away. Then I ever did before. Feel further. Than I can take. Dreamin' of you. That's all I do. But it's. Driving me insane. Everything in the way. Is so shy like the day. In queer and unusual form. Spirals of golden haze here. In there in a blaze. Like beams of light. In a star. Maybe you're here. Or maybe you weren't. Maybe you. Touched somebody. And got burned. The silent sun. Has got me on the run. Burning a hole. In my brain. I'm dreamin' of you. That's all I do. But it's. Driving me insane
2548,Bob Dylan,Rock,All the early Roman kings. In their shark skin suits. Bow ties and buttons. High top boots. Drivin' the spikes in. Blazin' the rails. Nailed in their coffins. Top hats and tails. Fly away over. Fly away flap your wings. Fly by night. Like the early Roman kings. They're peddlers and they're meddlers. They buy and they sell. They destroyed your city. They'll destroy you as well. They're lecherous and treacherous. A-Hell bent for leather. Each of 'em bigger. Than all men put together. Sluggers and muggers. Wearin' fancy gold rings. All the women going crazy. For the early Roman kings
2549,Bob Dylan,Rock,I sang the song slowly. As she stood in the shadows. She stepped to the light. As my silver strings spun. She called with her eyes. To the tune I's a-playin'. But the song it was long. And I'd only begun. Through a bullet of light. Her face was reflectin'. The fast fading words. That rolled from my tongue. With a long-distance look. Her eyes was on fire. But the song it was long. And there was more to be sung.. My eyes danced a circle. Across her clear outline. With her head tilted sideways. She called me again. As the tune drifted out. She breathed hard through the echo. But the song it was long. And it was far to the end. I glanced at my guitar. And played it pretendin'. That of all the eyes out there. I could see none. As her thoughts pounded hard. Like the pierce of an arrow. But the song it was long. And it had to get done. As the tune finally folded. I laid down the guitar. Then looked for the girl. Who'd stayed for so long. But her shadow was missin'. For all of my searchin'. So I picked up my guitar. And began the next song.

2552,Bob Dylan,Rock,Forgetful heart. Lost your power of recall. Every little detail. You don't remember at all. The times we knew. Who would remember better then you. Forgetful heart. We laughed and had a good time you and I. It's been so long. Now you're content to let the days go by. When you were there. You were the answer to my prayer. Forgetful heart. We loved with all the love that life can give. What can I say. Without you it's so hard to live. Can't take much more. Why can't we love like we did before. Forgetful heart. Like a walking shadow in my brain. All night long. I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain. The door has closed forevermore. If indeed there ever was a door
2553,Bob Dylan,Rock,Four strong winds that blow lonely. Seven seas that run high. All these things that won't change. Come what may. But the good times all are gone. And I'm bound for movin' on. I'll look for you if you ever come this way. Think I'll go down to alberta. Where there's good there in the fall. I've got some friends that I can go workin' for. But I wish you'd change your mind. If I ask you one more time. But we've been through that a hundred times or more. Four strong winds that blow lonely. Seven seas that run high. All these things that don't change. Come what may. But the good times are all gone. And I'm bound for movin' on. I'll look for you if you ever come this way. (A few lines are inaudible). But by then it would be springtime. There ain't too much for you to do. So I see you when I pass this way again. Four strong winds that blow lonely. Seven seas that run high. All these things that won't change. Come what may. But the good times are all gone. And I'm bound for movin' on. I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
2554,Bob Dylan,Rock,He was a friend of mine. He was a friend of mine. Every time I think about him now. Lord I just can't keep from cryin'. 'Cause he was a friend of mine. He died on the road. He died on the road. He never had enough money. To pay his room or board. And he was a friend of mine. I stole away and cried. I stole away and cried. 'Cause I never had too much money. And I never been quite satisfied. And he was a friend of mine. He never done no wrong. He never done no wrong. A thousand miles from home. And he never harmed no one. And he was a friend of mine. He was a friend of mine. He was a friend of mine. Every time I hear his name. Lord I just can't keep from cryin'. 'Cause he was a friend of mine.
2555,Bob Dylan,Rock,I could have told you. She'd hurt you. She'd love you a while. Then desert you. If only you asked. I could have told you so. I could have saved you. Some crying. Yes I could have told you she's lying. But you were in love. And didn't want to know. I hear her now. As I toss and turn and try to sleep. I hear her now. Making promises she'll never keep. And soon it's over. And done with. She'll find someone new to have fun with. Through all of my tears. I could have told you so. I hear her now. As I toss and turn and try to sleep. I hear her now. Making promises. She'll never keep. And soon it's over. And done with. She'll find someone new to have fun with. Through all of my tears. I could have told you so
2556,Bob Dylan,Rock,Well I'm sitting in church. In an old wooden chair. I knew nobody. Would look for me there. Sorrow and pity. Rule the earth and the skies. Looking for nothing. Anyone's eyes. Once I had pretty girls. Did me wrong. Now I'm marching to the city. And the road ain't long. Snowflakes are falling. Around my head. Lord have mercy. It feel heavy like lead. I been hit too hard. Seen too much. Nothing can heal me now. But your touch. Once I had a pretty girl. She done me wrong. Now I'm marching to the city. And the road ain't long. Loneliness. Got a mind of its own. The more people around. The more you feel alone. I'm chained to the earth. Like a silent slave. Trying to break free. Out of death's dark cave. Once I had a pretty girl. Done me wrong. Now I'm marching to the city. And the road ain't long. Boys in the street. Beginning to play. Girls like birds. Flying away. I'm carrying the roses. That were given to me. And I'm thinking about paradise. Wondering what it might be. Once I had a pretty girl. She done me wrong. Now I'm marching to the city. And the road ain't long. Go over to london. Maybe gay paree. Follow the river. You get to the sea. I was hoping we could drink from. Life's clear streams. I was hoping we could dream. Life's pleasant dreams. Once I had a pretty girl. But she done me wrong. Now I'm marching to the city. And the road ain't long. Well the weak get weaker. And the strong stay strong. The train keeps rolling. All night long. She looked at me. With an irresistable glance. With a smile. That could make all the planets dance. Once I had a pretty girl. She did me wrong. Now I'm marching to the city. And the road ain't long. My house is on fire. Burning to the skies. I thought the rain clouds. But the clouds passed by. When I'm gone. You'll remember my name. I'm gonna win my way. To wealth and fame. Once I had a pretty girl. But she did me wrong. Now I'm marching to the city. And the road ain't long. I don't know
2557,Bob Dylan,Rock,Come you masters of war. You that build the big guns. You that build the death planes. You that build all the bombs. You that hide behind walls. You that hide behind desks. I just don't want you to know. I can see through your masks. You that never done nothin'. But build to destroy. You play with my world. Like it's your little toy. You put a gun in my hand. And you hide from my eyes. And you turn and run farther. When the fast bullets fly. Like Judas of old. You lie and deceive. A world war can be won. You want me to believe. But I see through your eyes. And I see through your brain. Like I see through the water. That runs down my drain. You fasten all the triggers. For the others to fire. Then you set back and watch. When the death count gets higher. You hide in your mansion. As young people's blood. Flows out of their bodies. And is buried in the mud. You've thrown the worst fear. That can ever be hurled. Fear to bring children. Into the world. For threatening my baby. Unborn and unnamed. You ain't worth the blood. That runs in your veins. How much do I know. To talk out of turn. You might say that I'm young. You might say I'm unlearned. But there's one thing I know. Though I'm younger than you. Even Jesus would never. Forgive what you do. Let me ask you one question. Is your money that good. Will it buy you forgiveness. Do you think that it could. I think you will find. When your death takes its toll. All the money you made. Will never buy back your soul. And I hope that you die. And your death'll come soon. I will follow your casket. In the pale afternoon. And I'll watch while you're lowered. Down to your deathbed. And I'll stand o'er your grave. 'Til I'm sure that you're dead
2558,Bob Dylan,Rock,Each time I see a crowd of people. Just like a fool I stop and stare. It's really not the proper thing to do. But maybe you'll be there. I go out walking after midnight. Along the lonely thoroughfare. It's not the time or place to look for you. But maybe you'll be there. You said your arms. would always hold me. You said you lips. were mine alone to kiss. Now after all those things you told me. How can it end like this. Someday if all my prayers are answered. I'll hear a footstep on the stair. With anxious heart. I'll hurry to the door. And maybe you'll. Be there

My sails tonight are filled with perfume of Shalimar. And temple bells that guide me to her shore. And then I hold you in my arms. And love the way I loved before. On a little street in Singapore
2561,Bob Dylan,Rock,One for the road. One for my baby. One for the road. I cry alone at night. Please tell me it's only night. And she's calling me back at night. And she's already home.

One for the road. One for my baby. One for the road. This bottle is dried up too. And I'll be all cried up soon. I can't see no God on the moon. It's a long way to go. One for my baby. One for the road. One for my baby. One for the road. I cry alone at night. He's not alone at night. I'll be there my whole night. But I wish it was whole. One for my baby. One for the road. One for my baby. One for the road

Means another poor boy is underground.. Did you ever hear them church bells toll. Did you ever hear them church bells toll. Did you ever hear them church bells toll. Means another poor boy is dead and gone.. And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold. And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold. And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold. Now I believe what the Bible told.. There's just one last favor I'll ask for you. And there's one last favor I'll ask for you.

2565,Bob Dylan,Rock,Skylark. Have you anything to say to me. Won't you tell me where my love can be. Is there a meadow in the mist. Where someone's waiting to be kissed. Oh skylark. Have you seen a valley green with spring. Where my heart can go a-journeying. Over the shadows and the rain. To a blossom-covered lane. And in your lonely flight. Haven't you heard the music of the night. Wonderful music. Faint as a will o' the wisp. Crazy as a loon. Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon. Oh skylark. I don't know if you can find these things. But my heart is riding on your wings. So if you see them anywhere. Won't you lead me there
2566,Bob Dylan,Rock,I'm searching for phrases. To sing your praises. I need to tell someone. It's soon after midnight. And my day has just begun. A gal named Honey. Took my money. She was passing by. It's soon after midnight. And the moon is in my eye. My heart is cheerful. It's never fearful. I've been down on the killing floors. I'm in no great hurry. I'm not afraid of your fury. I've faced stronger walls than yours. Charlotte's a harlot. Dresses in scarlet. Mary dresses in green. It's soon after midnight. And I've got a date with the fairy queen. They chirp and they chatter. What does it matter?. They lie and dine in their blood. Two timing slim. Who's every heard of him?. I'll drag his corpse through the mud. It's now or never. More than ever. When i met you id didn't think you do. Its soon after midnight. And I don't want nobody but you
2567,Bob Dylan,Rock,Instrumental
2568,Bob Dylan,Rock,Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah. Ha-va-ne-gei-lah. O-de-ley-e-e-oo
2569,Bob Dylan,Rock,I buyed me a little dog. Color it was brown. I learned him how to whistle. Sing and dance and run. His legs they were 14 yards long. His ears they were quite broad. Around the world in a half a day. And on him I could ride. Sing Tattle O? Day. I buyed me a little bull. About four inches high. Everybody feared him. That ever heard him cry. When he begins to bellow. It made such a melodious sound. And all the walls in London town. Came tumbling to the ground. Sing Tattle O? Day. I buyed me a flock of sheep. I thought they were all weathers. Sometimes they yield at wolves. Sometimes they yield at feathers. I think mine are the very best sheep. For yielding increase. For every full change of the moon. They bring both lambs and geese. Sing Tattle O? Day. I buyed me a little box. About four acres square. I filled it full of guineas. And silver so fair. Oh now I? m bound for turkey. I travel like an ox. And in my big chest pocket. I carry my little box. Sing Tattle O? Day. I buyed me a little hen. All speckled gay and fair. I sat her on an oyster shell. She hatched me out a hare. The hare it sprang a handsome horse. Blew fifteen hens high. And him that tells a bigger tale. Would have to tell a lie. Sing Tattle O? Day
2570,Bob Dylan,Rock,There was a moon out in space. But a cloud drifted over it's face. You kissed me and went on your way. The night we called it a day. I heard the song of the spheres. Like a minor lament in my ears. I hadn't the heart left to pray. The night we called it a day. Soft through the dark. The hoot of an owl in the sky. Sad though his song. No bluer was he than I. The moon went down stars were gone. But the sun didn't rise with the dawn. There wasn't a thing left to say. The night we called it a day. There wasn't a thing left to say. The night we called it a day
2571,Bob Dylan,Rock,Well the woman that I love she's got a hook in her nose. Her eyebrows meet she wears sexy damn clothes. She screams when I stutter and she walks with a hop. I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop. You know I love her yeah I love her. I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world. If I ever lose her I'll go insane. I go Heaven crazy when she calls my name. She says baby baby baby I l-l-l-love you. There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do. You know I love her yeah I love her. I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world. The woman that I love she's got two flat feet. Her knees knock together walking down the street. She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed. She ain't much to look at but like I said. I love her yeah I love her. I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world. (She's so ugly.... gotta be ugly....). I don't mean to say that she's got nothing done. She's got a weird sense of humor that's all her own. When I get low she sets me on my feet. Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet. You know I love her (she's so ugly). yeah I love her (man she's ugly). I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world. (she's so ugly.... man she's ugly). (gotta be ugly.... woman be ugly). (ugly ugly.... she's so ugly). Well the woman that I love she's got a hook in her nose. Her eyebrows meet she wears sexy damn clothes. she screams when I stutter and she walks with a hop. I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop. You know I love her yeah I love her. I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
2572,Bob Dylan,Rock,You've long been on the open road. You've been sleepin in the rain. From the dirty words and muddy cells. Your clothes are soiled and stained. But the dirty words and muddy cells. Will soon be hid in shame. So only stop to rest yourself. Till you'll go off again. So take off your thirsty boots. And stay for awhile. Your feet are hot and weary. From a dusty mile. And maybe I can make you laugh. Maybe I can try. I'm just lookin' for the evening. And the morning in your eyes. But tell me of the ones you saw. As far as you could see. Across the plain from field to town. A-marching to be free. And of the rusted prison gates. That tumbled by degree. Like laughing children one by one. Who looked like you and me. So take off your thirsty boots. And stay for awhile. Your feet are hot and weary. From a dusty mile. And maybe I can make you laugh. Maybe I can try. I'm just lookin' for the evening. And the morning in your eyes. I know you are no stranger down. The crooked rainbow trails. From dancing cliff-edged shattered sills. Of slender shackled jails. But the voices drift up from below. As the walls they're being scaled. All of this and more. Your song shall not be failed. So take off your thirsty boots. And stay for awhile. Your feet are hot and weary. From a dusty mile. And maybe I can make you laugh. Maybe I can try. I'm just lookin' for the evening. And the morning in your eyes
2573,Bob Dylan,Rock,To be alone with you. Just you and me. Now won't you tell me true. Ain't that the way it oughta be?. To hold each other tight. the whole night through. Ev'rything is always right. When I'm alone with you.. To be alone with you. At the close of the day. With only you in view. While evening slips away. It only goes to show. That while life's pleasures be few. The only one I know. Is when I'm alone with you.. They say that nighttime is the right time. To be with the one you love. Too many thoughts get in the way in the day. But you're always what I'm thinkin' of. I wish the night were here. Bringin' me all of your charms. When only you are near. To hold me in your arms.. I'll always thank the Lord. When my working day's through. I get my sweet reward. To be alone with you.
2574,Bob Dylan,Rock,A tear go down. My day is real. But your dying eye. Upon the same. And need just road. For me from you. What paradise. What can I do?. That die for my. And the day is dark. I can't believe. For the end of time. What I could find. Oh time is rye-ou-lou. 'F I fell in love. To fall in love. To fall in love. With you. The day is dark. Our time is right. Day in the night. Deep in the night. I came dev be back. I hear-a my-a surprise. I see it in you live. I knew it in your eyes. Well I feel your love. And I feel no shame. I can't unleash your horde. I call your name. What were to me. What can I do?. To fall in love. To fall in love. To fall in love. With you. It just rolls. Upon the sand. Deverthisse now. I made the man. Can make you feel. What I can find. I know it in my days. Ah in my dreary mind. Oh will ages roll. Will ages fly. I hear your name. Where angel lie. What do I know?. For to come it's true. To fall in love. To fall in love. To fall in love. With you. How can the doors. A trust on a nail. How can I be surprised. Of most everything. Ah in the distant road. I can't be the same. I feel no love. I kill no shame. I can't watch the bay. Out on my an own. We've a destined man. I came atist it all. (I didn't) I could find. Where I could go. To fall in love. To fall in love. To fall in love. With you
2575,Bob Dylan,Rock,Instrumental
2576,Bob Dylan,Rock,What'll I do?. When you are far away. And I am blue. What'll I do?. What'll I do?. When I am wond'ring who. Is kissing you. What'll I do?. What'll I do with just a photograph. To tell my troubles to?. When I'm alone. With only dreams of you. That won't come true. What'll I do?. [One verse instrumental]. What'll I do with just a photograph. To tell my troubles to?. When I'm alone. With only dreams of you. That won't come true. What'll I do?
2577,Bob Dylan,Rock,Gone is the romance that was so divine. Tis broken and cannot be mended. You must go your way and I must go mine. But now that our love dreams have ended. What'll I do. When you are far away. And I am blue. What'll I do?. What'll I do?. When I am wondering who. Is kissing you. What'll I do?. What'll I do. With just a photograph. To tell my troubles to?. When I'm alone. With only dreams of you. That won't come true. What'll I do?. What'll I do. With just a photograph. To tell my troubles to?. When I'm alone. With only dreams of you. That won't come true. What'll I do?
2578,Bob Dylan,Rock,When did you leave heaven ?. How could they let you go ?. How's every thing in heaven ?. I'd like to know.. Why did you trade heaven ?. For all these earthly things ?. Where on earth did you hide your halo ?. Where did you lose your wings ?. Have they missed you ?. Can you get back in ?. If I kiss you would it be a sin ?. I am only human. but you are so divine.. When did you leave heaven. angel mine ?.

2581,Bob Dylan,Rock,Fairy tales can come true. It can happen to you. If you're young at heart. For it's hard you will find. To be narrow of mind. If you're young at heart. You can go to extremes. With impossible schemes. You can laugh when your dreams. Fall apart at the seams. And life gets more exciting. with each passing day. And love is either in your heart. Or on it's way. Don't you know that it's worth. Every treasure on earth. To be young at heart. For as rich as you are. It's much better by far. To be young at heart. And if you should survive to 105. Look at all you'll derive. Out of being alive. And here is the best part. You've had a head start. If you are among the very. Young at heart. And if you should survive. To a hundred and five. Look at all you'll derive. Out of being alive. And here is the best part. You've had a head start. If you are among the very. Young at heart. And if you should survive. To a hundred and five. Look at all you'll derive. Out of being alive. And here is the best part. You've had a head start. If you are among the very. Young at heart
2582,Bon Jovi,Rock,This Romeo is bleeding. But you can't see his blood. It's nothing but some feelings. That this old dog kicked up. It's been raining since you left me. Now I'm drowning in the flood. You see I've always been a fighter. But without you I give up. Now I can't sing a love song. Like the way it's meant to be. Well I guess I'm not that good anymore. But baby that's just me. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you always. Now your pictures that you left behind. Are just memories of a different life. Some that made us laugh. Some that made us cry. One that made you have to say good bye. What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair. To touch your lips to hold you near. When you say your prayers try to understand. I've made mistakes I'm just a man. When he holds you close. When he pulls you near. When he says the words. You've been needing to hear. I'll wish I was him cause these words are mine. To say to you till the end of time. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. If you told me to cry for you I could. If you told me to die for you I would. Take a look at my face. There's no price I won't pay. To say these words to you. Well there ain't no luck in this loaded dice. But baby if you give me just one more try. We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives. We'll find a place where the sun still shines. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you always
2583,Bon Jovi,Rock,I should have seen it coming when the roses died. Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes. I should have listened when you said good night. You really meant good bye. Baby ain't it funny how you never ever learn to fall. You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall. But only fools are know-it-alls and I've played that fool for you. I cried and cried. There were nights that I died for you baby. I tried and I tried to deny it that your love drove me crazy baby. If the love that I got for you is gone. If the river I've cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. Baby I thought you and me would. Stand the test of time. Like we got away with the perfect crime. But we were just a legend in my mind. I guess that I was blind. Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade. The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade. You and I were the renegades some things never change. It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby. And now it's so sad that whatever we had. Ain't worth saving oh oh oh. If the love that I've got for you is gone. If the river I've cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yes I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. If the pain that I'm feeling so strong. Is the reason that I'm holding on. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. I cried and I cried. There were nights that I died for you baby. I tried and I tried to deny it that. Your love drove me crazy. If the love that I got for you is gone. If the river I cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. If the pain that I'm feeling so strong. Is the reason that I'm holding on. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. oh oh oh no no
2584,Bon Jovi,Rock,Heavy is the head that wears the crown. All the people came to hear him speak from miles around. They hung on every word. a song in every sound. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. He touched the sky to light up all the stars. He could snap his fingers. and catch lightning in a jar. I am you and you are me and we are who we are. Touch the sky and light up all the stars. All hail the king whose castle's falling down. The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown. Poor man has his money. Rich man has his gold. All hail the king whose fortune is his soul. He climbed the clouds to heaven's highest hill. When you get that high the earth below looks just. like a blue pill. Gave wind to all his horses. and to all his men good will. When he climbed down from heaven's highest hill. All hail the king whose castle's falling down. The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown. Poor man has his money. Rich man has his gold. All hail the king whose fortune is his soul. He breathed his last they laid him in the ground. False prophets spoke of riches and said. all hail to us now. The faithful wouldn't listen and they never would bow down. He breathed his last they laid him in the ground. All hail the king whose castle's falling down. The paper prince who wears a cardboard crown. Poor man has his money. Rich man has his gold. All hail the king whose fortune is his soul

2586,Bon Jovi,Rock,Bounce B-Side. O beautiful for spacious skies. For amber waves of grain. For purple mountain majesties. Above the fruited plains. America! America!. God shed His grace on thee. And crown thy good with brotherhood. From sea to shining sea. O beautiful for patriot dream. That sees beyond the years. Thine alabaster cities gleam. Undimmed by human tears. America! America!. God shed His grace on thee. And crown thy good with brotherhood. From sea to shining sea. I'm talking about yours and mine. America! America!. God shed His grace on thee. And crown thy good with brotherhood. From sea to shining sea. Yes it did. And crown thy good with brotherhood. From sea to shining sea
2587,Bon Jovi,Rock,Take me now baby here as I am. Pull me close try and understand. I work all day out in the hot sun. Stay with me now till the mornin' comes. Come on now try and understand. The way I feel when I'm in your hands. Take me now as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us
2588,Bon Jovi,Rock,I just seen trouble. He's calling out your name tonight. Billy get your guns. You could walk away. But I know you were born to fight. So Billy get your guns. The bandileros are strung out. In the promenade. Billy get your guns. Chorus. Billy get your guns. There's trouble blowing like a hurricane. Billy get your guns. That's the price on your head for the. Price of fame. And it'll never change. Billy get your guns. There's a whiskey bottle empty. Sittin' on the bar. Billy get your guns. And some organ grinder singing. About some sucker moving on. Billy get your guns. All the whores are hanging out. Waiting to get paid. Billy get your guns. From some Johnny on the spot. Who said hey keep the change baby. Billy get your guns. There's trouble blowing like a hurricane. Billy get your guns. That's the price on your head for the. Price of fame. And it'll never change
2589,Bon Jovi,Rock,Come on up to our house. Let us make you feel at home. Come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. I wish tonight would last forever. And it would never end. We were introduced as strangers. Now we're leaving here as friends. Every word that you speak is a melody. As we're writing the songs of our lives. Everyone knows we don't want to go home. But we can't stay here tonight. Come on up to our house. Let us make you feel at home. Come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. All are welcome at our table. You can never stay too long. Come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. You could tell me your life story. I could finish every line. The one about hurt and the heartache. It still gets me every time. Every word that you speak is the harmony. To the song that I'm singing inside. Everyone knows we don't want to go home. But we can't stay here tonight. Come on up to our house. Let us make you feel at home. Come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. All are welcome at our table. You can never stay too long. Come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. I wish tonight could last forever. 'Cause I ain't good at saying goodbye. Everyone knows we don't want to go home. But we can't stay here tonight. Come on up to our house. Let us make you feel at home. Come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. For the restless and the weary. You will never be alone. All are welcome at our table. You can never stay too long. So come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. Come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. Come on up to our house. Let us make you feel at home. Come on up to our house. I will leave the porch light on. Come on up to our house. Let us make you feel at home. Come on up to our house
2590,Bon Jovi,Rock,Across the border they turn. Water into wine. Some say it's the devil's blood. They're squeezing from the vine. Some say it's a saviour. In these hard and desperate times. For me it helps me to forget. That we're just born to die. I came here like so many did. To find the better life. To find my piece of easy street. To finally be alive. And I know nothing good comes easy. All good things take some time. I made my bed I lie in it. To die in it's the crime. You can't help but prosper. When the street are paved with gold. They say the oil wells ran deeper here. Than anybody's known. I packed up on my wife and kid. And left them back at home. Now there's nothing in this paydirt. The ghost are all I know. Now the oil's gone. The money's gone. And the jobs are gone. Still we're hangin' on. Down in dry county. They're swimming in the sand. Praying for some holy water. To wash the sins from off our hands. Here in dry county. The promise has run dry. Where nobody cries. And no one's getting out of here alive. In the blessed name of Jesus. I heard a preacher say. That we are God's children. And that he'd be back someday. And I hoped that he knew. Something as he drank his cup of wine. I didn't have too good of a feeling. As I head out to the night. I cursed the sky to open. I begged the clouds for rain. I prayed to God for water. For this burning in my veins. It was like my soul's on fire. And I had to watch the flames. All my dreams went up in ashes. And my future blew away. Now the oil's gone. The money's gone. And the jobs are gone. Still we're hangin' on. Down in dry county. They're swimming in the sand. Praying for some holy water. To wash the sins from off our hands. Here in dry county. The promise has run dry. Where nobody cries. And no one's getting out of here alive. Men spend their whole lives. Waiting praying for their big reward. But it seems sometimes. The payoff leaves you feeling. Like a dirty whore. If I could choose the way I'll die. Make it by the gun or knife. 'Couse the other way there's too much pain. night after night after night.... Down in dry county. They're swimming in the sand. Praying for some holy water. To wash the sins from off our hands. Here in dry county. The promise has run dry. Where nobody cries. And no one's getting out of here alive
2591,Bon Jovi,Rock,A whiskey bottle comforts me. And tells me not to cry. While a full moon says a prayer for me. I try to close my eyes. But the night's there to remind me. Of the guns and the early graves. The ghosts appear as I fall asleep. To sing an outlaw's serenade. Dyin' ain't much of a livin'. When you're livin' on the run. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. Is it too late to ask for forgiveness. For the things that I have done. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. The desert's been a friend to me. It covers me by night. And a snakebite's not my enemy. But it taught me how to fight. All this fame don't bring you freedom. Though it wears a thin disguise. When an outlaw is just a man to me. And a man has to die. Dyin' ain't much of a livin'. When you're livin' on the run. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. Is it too late to ask for forgiveness. For the things that I have done. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. And I hope someone will pray for me. When it's my turn to die... PRAY FOR ME !!!. Dyin' ain't much of a livin'. When you're livin' on the run. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. Is it too late to ask for forgiveness. For the things that I have done. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young.
2592,Bon Jovi,Rock,"""I see you looking over your shoulder. Tell me who do you think's out there. You're reaching for your four leaf clover. But baby there ain't no luck down there. I swear that there's no heart in this city. It's here the slogan reads """"Do your time"""". everybody's doing their sentence. It's just there ain't nobody here. Who knows just what's the crime. I watched my father live a lie here. I'd rather die than fade away. I read the rules. And yeah I know them. Still you ain't ever gonna. Make me play the game of Fear Fear Fear Fear. Running with the rats. Through the city. Makes you feel like you're a partner in crime. Girl once you won't stop to watch. That little girl did. Hey baby won't you stop and hear me. Just being here we're breathing heart attacks. We can run and chase. The setting sun we can run. And we won't ever look back. Take my hand I know we'll make it. I'll let nothing slow us down I know you want to curse. This place but there's only. One thing that's stopping us now. Fear fear fear Of a new thing Fear fear fear. Of the brass ring. You ain't one for taking chances. You work and live and breathe that 9 to 5. Still that's what you call living. That's surviving to me. And surviving is living to die in. Fear"""
2593,Bon Jovi,Rock,I gave you my fingerprints. Left them all over you. Tangled up in your sheets. This heartache's the only proof. I gave you my fingerprints. Now just like you they're gone. The man invisible. I'll be him from now on. The last time that I saw them. They were running through your hair. You held one between your lips. And brought another there. The last time that I saw them. I haven't seen them since. No matter who or what I touch. I leave no evidence. I gave you my fingerprints. I said I'd give you everything. But who thought you'd take it all. Does a promise really break. If nobody sees it fall. A hard rain can't wash away. The taste of your memory. Don't know what I would do. If you should stop haunting me. The last time that I saw them. They were running through your hair. You held one between your lips. And brought another there. The last time that I saw them. Unbuttoning your dress. Those pretty pictures in my head. Are the only thing you left. I gave you my fingerprints. That shiny box I gave to you. Was all there was to me. All it was to you was just a faded memory. I gave her my fingerprints. Guilty or innocent. I have to ask myself. Would I do it all again. Would I. The last time that I saw them. They were running through your hair. You held one between your lips. And brought another there. The last time that I saw them. I haven't seen them since. No matter who or what I touch. I leave no evidence. I gave you my finger prints

2595,Bon Jovi,Rock,I - I will be king. And you - you will be my queen. I I wish you could swim. Like dolphins - like dolphins can swim. Though nothing will keep us together. We can beat them - forever and ever. We can be heroes - just for one day. I - I will be king. And you - you will be queen. Though nothing will drive them away. We can beat them - just for one day. We can be heroes - just for one day. I - I can remember (remember). Standing - by the wall (by the wall). And the guns - shot above our heads (our heads). And we kissed - as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall). And the shame - was on the other side. Oh we can beat them - forever and ever. Then we could be heroes - just for one day. We can be heroes. We can be heroes. We can be heroes. Just for one day. We can be heroes
2596,Bon Jovi,Rock,Look at this world. It's filled with worn out places. Forgotten places and nothing changes. Whatever happened. To that new day rising. We're just surviving when living is dying. Aren't you tired of being let down. Another day. Another shakedown. (I'm with you). When hope is gone and all you want is the truth. (I'm with you). You carry on when they say it's no use. I'm with you. I'm with you. If I got one thing. I got something to prove. We all got nothing. If there's nothing to lose. I'm with you. I walk in shadows. They seem more familliar. I read the papers. A life forsaken. A vacant storefront. I'm one more for sale sign. Down on main street. You just walk by. How many times you gotta break down. Before somebody's. Gonna shout out. (I'm with you). When hope is gone and all you want is the truth. (I'm with you). You carry on when they say it's no use. I'm with you. I'm with you. If I got one thing. I got something to prove. We all got nothing. If there's nothing to lose. I'm with you. When hope is gone. And all you want is the truth. I'm with you. You carry on when they say it's no use. They say it's no use. If I got one thing. I've got something to prove. We all got nothing. If there's nothing to lose. I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with you
2597,Bon Jovi,Rock,Hey mister can you help me. I'm a loner on the run. I'm just looking for tomorrow. And I ain't gonna hurt no one. I jumped headfirst into a bottle. I was looking for a friend. Came up just short of nothing. I didn't find the truth I only found an end. So tell me who's gonna save me. Or my father or my son. When the only justice a man can see. Is the barrel... of a loaded gun. I been broke and I've been hungry. I think they're both my middle name. But I don't never ever never seem to get enough. Still guess I can't complain. 'Cause what you get in life you take it. You've gotta hold on and make it last. They say good things come to those who wait. But it's life that goes so fast. And when there's just one rule you live by. Each day you kiss the rising sun. When you live and die by the life we breathe. In the barrel of a loaded gun. Guns talk to me in my sleep at night. And a gun somewhere is burning. With my name. Winners are losers. And losers will have to face. All those yesterdays. And all of the dreams they blew away. So Mister can you help me. Or are you my gun. Have the ghosts of justice. Brought you here to me to taste. The barrel of a loaded gun. There's justice in the barrel. Of a loaded gun.
2598,Bon Jovi,Rock,There are days when she's a whisper. Nights when she's a scream. A reason to wake up in the morning. To close your eyes and dream. She'll curse you like a sailor. She'll wound you with her eyes. She’ll always make it better. But won't apologize. You know everything about her but don't know her at all. Chorus:. She's a ride on a mystery train. To a place you've never been before. Better hold on tight to that mystery train. You're not in Kansas anymore. She's a ride. Mystery train. She cries because she's happy. She sings songs when she's mad. Like a stiff drink when you need it. She's good at being bad. And long before you knew her you knew she was the one. Chorus:. She's a ride on a mystery train. To a place you've never been before. Better hold on tight to that mystery train. You're not in Kansas anymore. She's a ride. Mystery train. Solo. I know everything about her but don't know her at all. Chorus:. She's a ride on a mystery train. To a place I've never been before. I waited all night out for that mystery train. I'm not in Kansas anymore. She's a ride. On a mystery train. She's a ride. On a mystery train.
2599,Bon Jovi,Rock,I feel just like Picasso. And you're my masterpiece. I've painted you a lifetime. Now what's left are memories. Sunlight through the curtains. Diamonds in the trees. I gave you colors blue and gold. As you lay upon the sheets. Something so familiar. Drawn from this blank page. Every line from my hand. Takes me back to what I can't erase. No matter how I try. No matter what I do. I'm still painting pictures of you. I could almost smell your perfume. In each brush stroke of the flowers. I left you tea from China. Waiting in your sacred tower. Something so familiar. Drawn from this blank page. Every line from my hand. Takes me back to what I can't erase. No matter how I try. No matter what I do. I'm still painting pictures of you.. If I should go crazy. If I would go blind. I'd still fill the canvas. From the pictures in my mind. If that's the only way to make you mine. It was something so familiar. Drawn from this blank page. Every line from my hand. Takes me back to what I can't erase. No matter how I try. No matter what I do. I'm still painting pictures. I'm always painting pictures. Still painting pictures of you
2600,Bon Jovi,Rock,You – you got a nasty reputation. We’re in a sticky situation – it’s down to me and you. So tell me – is it true… they say there ain’t nobody better. Well now that we’re together. Show me what you can do. You’re under the gun. Out on the run. Gonna set the night on fire. You’re out on the run. Under the gun. And playn’ to win. Raise your hands. When you want to let it go. Raise your hands. When you want to let a feeling show. Raise your hands. From New York to Chicago. Raise your hands. From New Jersey to Tokyo. Raise your hands. I – I’ve been out on the front line. Where you go down if you waste time. They’ll walk all over you. But I – I ain’t here looking for surrender. I’ll raise the flag if you’ll defend her. It’s up to you. You’re under the gun. Out on the run. Gonna set the night on fire. You’re out on the run. Under the gun. And playn’ to win. Raise your hands. When you want to let it go. Raise your hands. When you want to let a feeling show. Raise your hands. From New York to Chicago. Raise your hands. From New Jersey to Tokyo. Raise your hands.
2601,Bon Jovi,Rock,I wish that life was like it is in the movies. 'Cause the hero always gets his way. No matter how hard it gets on that dark lonely road. At the end he´s got a smile on his face. But when they threw me out to the lions. Noone saved me as I fell from your grace. And noone wrote me new lines. For what I said wrong. What I did wrong I could not erase. This is real life. This is real love. This is real pain. That much I'm sure of. These are real tears. These are real fears inside. That I can't hide. I wish that I could be a white knight in armour. With an army just to bring you back home. But I'll admit I'm scared of dialing your number. Someone else is gonna answer the phone. Why can't it be like it is on TV. When the orchestra plays and you come back to me. This is real life. This is real love. This is real pain. That much I'm sure of. These are real tears. These are real fears inside. I can't hide. This is real life. This is real love. These are real wounds I'm bleeding from. And I realize this is real. I always thought that our love. Was a story book tale. God knows that I'd never dream. In the end it could fail. 'Cause this is real life. This is real love. This is real pain. That much I'm sure of. These are real tears. These are real fears inside. That I can't hide. This is real life. This is real love. These are real wounds I´m bleeding from. And I realize this is real.
2602,Bon Jovi,Rock,Ride cowboy ride. Through the backdoor of Heaven. To the other side. I wanna know the danger of the kiss. At midnight. Ride cowboy ride. Yeah I learned my lessons. Here's a story to tell. So I make my confessions. In this sleazy motel. I could be a romantic. I could try my best lines. But I ain't got the money. And we ain't got the time. Ride cowboy ride. Through the backdoor of Heaven. To the other side. I wanna know the danger of a kiss. At midnight. I wanna be a big shot. Ride ride ride. Ride cowboy ride. Through the backdoor of Heaven. To the other side. I wanna know the danger of the kiss. At midnight.

2604,Bon Jovi,Rock,She won't let me buy her jewelry. She don't want things that she can keep. She wears wild flowers in her hair. Then throws them to the sea. She's the beginning and the end of me but. Chorus:. She's a mystery. My most beautiful regret. I will never understand her. She's a mystery. I still don't know what to call her. She says that words don't mean a thing. She changes her name every day. And lies all the time. I feel lucky to call her mine. Chorus:. She's a mystery. My most beautiful regret. I will never understand her. She's a mystery. The only promise I can keep. Even in my dreams she ruins me. She's anything in the world. That you cannot explain. But when she throws me a smile. It's like fire in the rain but. Chorus:. She's a mystery. My most beautiful regret. I will never understand her. She's a mystery. She's a mystery. There's no defense. It's innocence. But she won't let you see. 'Cause she's a mystery.
2605,Bon Jovi,Rock,I should have seen it coming when the roses died. Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes. I should have listened when you said good night. You really meant good bye. Baby ain't it funny how you never ever learn to fall. You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall. But only fools are know-it-alls and I've played that fool for you. I cried and cried. There were nights that I died for you baby. I tried and I tried to deny it that your love drove me crazy baby. If the love that I got for you is gone. If the river I've cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. Baby I thought you and me would. Stand the test of time. Like we got away with the perfect crime. But we were just a legend in my mind. I guess that I was blind. Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade. The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade. You and I were the renegades some things never change. It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby. And now it's so sad that whatever we had. Ain't worth saving oh oh oh. If the love that I've got for you is gone. If the river I've cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yes I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. If the pain that I'm feeling so strong. Is the reason that I'm holding on. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. I cried and I cried. There were nights that I died for you baby. I tried and I tried to deny it that. Your love drove me crazy. If the love that I got for you is gone. If the river I cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. If the pain that I'm feeling so strong. Is the reason that I'm holding on. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. oh oh oh no no
2606,Bon Jovi,Rock,Thorn in my side. You're always there. Just to remind me. That I still care. Thorn in my side. You won't let me go. Right there beside me. To let me know. I've been pushed around. Been knocked down. Lost a round or three. Life took a couple of things I loved. When I was too blind to see. But I'll survive. I gave up on luck but I'm still getting by. Yeah I'm going to be alright. You can test my faith. But you can't take my pride. Thorn in my side. Thorn in my side. You just won't quit. Once in a while when I crack a smile. You rub my face in it.

2607,Bon Jovi,Rock,My mama told me. When I was younger. You better speak up. Don't be a number. My daddy told me. When there was thunder. Go be the lightning. Don't run for cover. Who's gonna help the helpless. Sometimes we're all alone. These days we're all just looking. For a place that we call home. Now we can't climb over. And you can't go 'round. Build them up. We'll tear them down. Brick by brick. Gonna watch them fall. Build more bridges. And tear down walls. These walls. Are the mountains that we climb. These walls. Are the great divide. Brick by brick.

Are the mountains that we climb. These walls. Are the great divide. Brick by brick. Gonna watch them fall. Build more bridges. Tear down walls. Tear down walls. Tear down walls
2608,Bon Jovi,Rock,Today you'll pick up all the pieces. And get on with your life. All I can hope is that you're happy. 'Cause today you're someone elses wife. Right now I wish that I could turn back. And beg the hands of time. For the days that I remember (oh baby). The days when you were mine. And if I never said I love you. It's cause the words got in the way. Now all I do is say I'm sorry. Sorry I missed your wedding day. I'll bet you looked good at the altar. I'll bet he knew the words to say. And the angels smiled when you walked down the aisle. You both knelt down to pray. As he put his ring on your finger. I know there's just one thing left to say. All I can do is say I'm sorry. Sorry I missed your wedding day. So Sorry. (solo). You won't be walking through the door anymore. You won't be sleeping in this bed anymore. Tho' I swear I see your shadow waltz accross my floor. And I don't know if I can take it. Should we ever meet again. Cause I know that we'll be strangers. When he introduces friends. I tried to make it to the church now baby. A broken heart got in the way. All I can do is tell you I'm sorry. Sorry I missed your wedding day. I really hope you're happy baby. Tho' it's killing me to say. All I can do is say I'm sorry. Sorry I missed you're wedding day. Sorry I missed you're wedding. I'm sorry I missed you're wedding day. I'm sorry I missed you're wedding day. I'm sorry I missed you're wedding day.

2610,Bon Jovi,Rock,I could roll the dice. And give you ten good reasons. I could break the ice. And pick up the broken pieces. I could wave hello. I could raise a glass. I could blow a kiss. I could kick your ass. We could take it all apart. Or hold it all together. With these two hands. I can tear down walls. I can build a bridge. I can break my fall. With these two hands. I can pray or fight. I can hold the torch. I can shine a light. With these two hands. I could strike a match. That sets the world on fire. Hold a grain of sand. Till it turns into a diamond. I could plant the seed. I could flip that switch. Make the sign of peace. I could make a fist. Oh we could make this hurt. Or we could make it better. With these two hands. I can tear down walls. I can build a bridge. I can break my fall. With these two hands. I can pray or fight. I can hold the torch. I can shine a light. With these two hands. Wipe the teardrops from your eyes. Reach up until we touch the sky. Free to dream and make it true. No there ain't nothing we can't do. Oh there ain''t nothing we can't do
2611,Bon Jovi,Rock,You're dancing with your shadow. You been talking in your sleep. Well you can walk on water. But don't want to wet your feet. You really got me. You really got me now. You know I don't know how you do it. But you really put me through it. You got me. You say you talk to everyone. Who is anyone in town. But they don't recognize you. With your foot out of your mouth. You really got me. You really got me now. You know I don't know how you do it. But you really put me through it. You got me. Who am I to judge a man. Who says he's his own biggest fan. It's true. You brought a knife out to a gunfight. And you're shouting that I'm dead. My old friends Smith and Wesson. Think you're in over your head. You really got me. You really got me now. You know I don't know how you do it. But you really put me through it. You got me. Repeat.

2613,Breakeven,Rock,Você não pode ficar aqui. Assombrando a minha casa. É a hora de partir. Pra nunca mais voltar. Cego pela sombra da incerteza. A escuridão me fez mudar. Eu não sou mais quem eu era. Não me force a te provar. Incendeie as memórias. E assista queimar. Por favor me deixe ir. E liberte a minha alma. O amor nos destruiu. Agora é só mais um fantasma. Que eu tentei exorcizar. A sua voz continua ecoar. Eu não sou mais quem eu era. Não me force a te provar. Incendeie as memórias. E assista queimar. Por tanto tempo esperei. Até o fogo se apagar. Por um segundo eu achei. Que no final tudo ia mudar. Eu não sou mais quem eu era. Não me force a te provar. Incendeie as memórias. E assista queimar
2614,Bruno Silva,Rock,Ela se vestiu e por aqui passou. Ela se despiu e nada levou. Simpatizou com o que já era. De pés descalços e sumiu. Ela se feriu e nada alcançou. Mas no escuro também dançou. Toda simples e flor na cabeça. À sua espera aqui estou. Ela vai passar por aqui. Ela vai passar por aqui. Ela se vestiu e por aqui passou. Ela se despiu e nada levou. Simpatizou com o que já era. De pés descalços e sumiu. Ela se feriu e nada alcançou. Mas no escuro também dançou. Toda simples e flor na cabeça. À sua espera aqui estou. Ela vai passar por aqui. Ela vai passar por aqui
2615,Bruno Silva,Rock,Sempre andei por perseguir seus lábios de carvão. Esperei você partir para decidi então. Que eu prefiro ficar nessa terra. Tão rachada quanto o meu coração. Sinto-me assim numa nova era. Ainda regado apenas de emoção. Quantos ventos que passaram e a noite se perdeu. Boas novas não chegaram e o dia também morreu. Só você podia me compreender. Qualquer um na rua pode ver. Nuvens densas molham sem querer. Esse solo seco que hei de conviver. Esperei que você chegasse no dia de amanhã. Para que também encontrasse a minha vida pagã. Onde vejo as plantas murchas na janela. E os animais raquíticos de sentinela. A cruz na parede não mais está. Sustentando a ilusão de que você possa voltar
2616,Bruno Silva,Rock,Sempre andei sozinho à procura de um abrigo. Para poder esperar a chuva passar. Asas tão podadas. Direção era contrária e o rádio não tinha comunicação. Velas Içadas; mas a nau ancorada. Todo e qualquer guia escapou da minha mão. Qual é a direção?. Qual é a direção?. Qual é a direção que eu devo seguir?. Sempre andei sozinho na direção do inimigo. Para estender a mão e podê-la apertar. Algemas quebradas; mas estrada bloqueada. E a bússola não indicava direção. Cartas endereçadas chegavam a nenhum lugar. Sinais de fumaça confundiam-se com o ar. Qual é a direção?. Qual é a direção?. Qual é a direção que eu devo seguir?
2617,Bryan Adams,Rock,I could start dreamin' but it'd never ends. As long as you're gone we may as well pretend. I've been dreamin'. Straight from the heart. You said it's easy but who's to say. That we'd be able to keep it this way. But it's easier. Comin' straight from the heart. Give it to me straight from the heart. Tell me we can make another start. You know I'll never go - as long as I know. It's comin' straight from the heart. I'll see you on the street some other time. And all our words would just fall outta line. While we're dreamin'. Straight from the heart. Give it to me straight from the heart. Tell me we can make one more start. You know I'll never go - as long as I know. It's comin' straight from the heart
2618,Bryan Adams,Rock,Here I am - this is me. There's no where else on earth I'd rather be. Here I am - it's just me and you. Tonight we make our dreams come true. Chorus:.

Do I have to say the words?. Do I have to tell the truth?. Do I have to shout it out?. Do I have to say a prayer?. Must I prove to you. - How good we are together?. Do I have to say the words?. Rescue me from despair. Tell me you will be there. Help me please - darlin' rescue me. Every dream that we share. Every cross that we bear. Can't you see - darlin' rescue me. I don't wanna let you go. So I'm standin' in your way. I never needed anyone. Like I'm needin' you today. Do I have to say the words?. Do I have to tell the truth?. Do I have to shout it out?. Do I have to say a prayer?. Must I prove to you. - How good we are together?. Do I have to say the words?
2620,Bryan Adams,Rock,When you love someone - you'll do anything. You'll do all the crazy things that you can't explain. You'll shoot the moon - put out the sun. When you love someone. You'll deny the truth - believe a lie. There'll be times that you'll believe you can really fly. But your lonely nights - have just begun. When you love someone. When you love someone - you'll feel it deep inside. And nothin else can ever change your mind. When you want someone - when you need someone. When you love someone.... When you love someone - you'll sacrifice. You'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice. You'd risk it all - no matter what may come. When you love someone. You'll shoot the moon - put out the sun. When you love someone
2621,Bryan Adams,Rock,"""Some people walk the straight and narrow - some walk the rocky road. some get the silver spoon and some get the heavy load. there's a man in a paper box he smiles whenever we walk by. we just walk a little faster and say """"there but for the grace of God go I"""". but a little love - just a little love - a little love can change it all. I've been up and down this highway and I ain't seen a road sign yet. it's a cold hard world baby you gotta hang on to what you get. I don't believe in miracles but that don't mean they don't come true. well I may not get to heaven but I get a little closer when I'm with you. but a little love - just a little love - a little love can change it all. . well I get a little tired walkin' down the street. people on my side - everyone I meet. but they don't know what's on my mind. and they don't know that they might find. a little love - just a little love - a little love can change it all. . right when you think you don't need love is when you need it most. even if you got the father the son and the holy ghost. well there's more to truth baby than what we know is true. ya we wander round in the darkness. but every now and then a little light shines thru. and a little love - just a little love - a little love can change it all"""
2622,Bryan Adams,Rock,You might stop a hurricane. Might even stop the drivin' rain. You might have a dozen other guys. But if you wanna stop me baby - don't even try. I'm goin' one way - your way. It's such a strong way - let's make it our way. Chorus. Can't stop this thing we started. You gotta know it's right. Can't stop this course we've plotted. This thing called love we got it.

2632,Bryan Adams,Rock,Deep down in Mississippi. I found my sweet delta blues. She weaved a little southern spell on me. Made a little voodoo. She was born the bright side of midnight. When her mama was seventeen. She was a hot blooded - god fearin' - gospel girl. The finest that I ever seen. She's black coffee - little bit 'o cream. Sweet brown sugar - my midnight dream. Black pearl - my kinda girl. Just the kind of thing to rock my world. Black pearl - she's my kinda girl. Met her in a dixie diner. Put on the southern hospitality. I can still smell her sweet molasses. Running all over me. We started rollin' like the river. Like a twister tearin' through the town. Tongue tied - satisfied - 'n southern fried. As she drove this ol' dixie down. She's black coffee - little bit 'o cream. Sweet brown sugar - my midnight dream. Black pearl - my kinda girl. Just the kind of thing to rock my world. Black pearl - she's my kinda girl. Yeah she's alright - yeah she's ok. Makin' love night - she really made my day.
2633,Bryan Adams,Rock,"""She gotta nasty reputation. And a talent for sin. She's the kinda trouble. I like to be in. I wanna be her lover. I wanna be her slave. She's the kinda woman. That makes me wanna misbehave. She said """"i'll give ya what you want boy. But let's make it understood. If ya wanna be bad you gotta be good"""". She's say's """"there'll be no more lyin'. No more foolin' around. No more seven day weekends. No more nights on the town"""". She said """"that's the way I want it. That's the way it's gotta be. If yer lookin' for trouble. Better get it from me. So get on your knees boy. And do what you should. If you wanna be bad you gotta be good"""". Let's make a night. To remember. From january. To december. Let's make a love.

2651,Bryan Adams,Rock,I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream. Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream. Pull the cover up high. And pray for the mornin' light. Cause you're livin' alone. In the heat of the night. Met a man with a message from the other side. Couldn't take the pressure. Had to leave it behind. He said it's up to you. You can run or you can fight (Ya that's right). Better leave it alone. In the heat of the night. In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around. There'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down. In the heat of the night. (Where ya gonna hide when it all comes down). (Don't look back don't ever turn around). Had to pay the piper to call the tune. Said he'd be back someday. Said he'd be back real soon. Pull the shades down low. You'll know when the time is right. When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night
2652,Bryan Adams,Rock,Here I am - this is me. There's no where else on earth I'd rather be. Here I am - it's just me and you. Tonight we make our dreams come true. Chorus:.

And after all this time - our time has come. Yeah here we are - still goin'strong. Right here in the place where we belong. Chorus. Here I am - this is me.

2655,Bryan Adams,Rock,When I was younger. My life was torn asunder. And I was carried far away. Now somewhere in the distance. I feel a strange insistance. I long to be there once again. The day is drawing nearer. The time has come to leave here. The feeling just keeps gettin' stronger every day. So I pray for the moment when I'll be with you. And all that we hoped for is all comin' true. When the time we've spent waitin' is finally through. I'll be home again. I can still remember. Days that never ended. Standin' on a distant shore. With every raindrop fallin'. I hear the thunder callin'. Like so many times before. Sometimes in the darkness. I hear what my heart says. Maybe one day I'll know what that feelings for. So I wait for the moment when I'll be with you. And all that we hoped for is all comin' true. The time we've spent waitin' is finally through. I'll be home again. When you're out there on your own. It can chill you to the bone. There's a cold wind blowin'. But it feels good knowin'. The worst is over now - I'm finally goin' home. It's gettin' stronger. Can't wait any longer.
2656,Bryan Adams,Rock,Was it some man that didn't treat you right. Left you reaching out for him in the middle of the night. Is there some heartache that you can't out run. That makes you so afraid to get close to anyone. You're so - easy to look at. You're so easy to hold. It's so easy to touch you - but so hard to let go. It's so easy to want you - that I can't get enough. Tell me why do ya have to be. Why do ya have to be so hard to love. Is it some hurt from long ago. That makes it so hard to let your feelings show. Is it the ghost of who you used to be. That makes you so afraid to bear your soul to me
2657,Bryan Adams,Rock,Well there's gonna be a party gonna make some noise. Yeah we're invitin' all the girls - invitin' all the boys. There'll be dancin' on the tables dancin' on the chairs. Ya there'll be dancin' in the parkin' lots. And up and down the stairs - alright. Close the windows - lock the doors. Turn it up now - pack the floors. Cops are on the outside - landlord's on the phone. Quick turn out all the lights. Pretend there ain't nobody home!. It's a house arrest - everybody run. I gotta plead guilty havin' - too much fun. This is a house arrest - up against the wall. We can't stop rockin' justa havin' a ball - One and all. Won't you come around to my place. Don't cha know it's overdue. You gotta bring your little lady wear your dancin' shoes. Get a Yellow Taxi - take a limousine. You gotta get there - it's gonna be a scene. it's too late can't wait - get out while you can. It was fun while it lasted let's do it all again. It's a house arrest - everybody run. I gotta plead guilty havin' - too much fun. This is a house arrest - up against the wall.

This is a house arrest everybody move. Gotta plead guilty gonna raise the roof. This is a house arrest...!.
2658,Bryan Adams,Rock,Is there anybody out there?. Anyone that's loved in vain. Anyone that feels the same. Is there anybody waiting?. Waiting for a chance to win. Give it up and start again. We all need something new. Something that is true. And someone else to feel it too. Cuz' I feel so high. No one else would know it. I don't know why I feel the way I do. I can' t let go. And I'm not scared to show it. Cuz being here feels right. Tell me. How do ya feel tonight?. Is there anybody out there?. Anyone that can't explain. Anyone that feels no pain. Is there anybody dreaming. Dreaming of better day. When everything goes your way. We all need something new. Something that is true. And someone else to feel it too. Someone just like you
2659,Bryan Adams,Rock,I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind. To live in memories of old lonesome times. I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say. So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday. Those happy hours. That we once knew though long ago still make me blue. They say that time heels the broken heart. But time is stood still since we've been apart. I can't stop loving you
2660,Bryan Adams,Rock,all i want is a real fast car. i wanna go too fast - i wanna go too far. i wanna take a bite of this sweet sweet life. while the gettin' is good and the time right. i wanna fill my cup - i wanna drink it up.. i don't wanna live forever. i just wanna go for broke. gonna ride thru any kind of weather. go out in a cloud of smoke. i don't wanna live - don't wanna live forever. don't wanna live - don't wanna live forever. all i need is a good excuse. you can cut my reins and turn me loose. i'm gonna pull my weight i'm gonna push my luck. i'm gonna go down fightin' when my time is up. you know i don't care - i'm gonna get my share.. i don't wanna live forever. i just wanna go for broke. gonna ride thru any kind of weather. go out in a cloud of smoke. i don't wanna live - don't wanna live forever. don't wanna live - don't wanna live forever. i wanna fill my cup - i wanna drink it up. ya - i don't care i wanna get my share. i don't wanna live forever....
2661,Bryan Adams,Rock,I oughta be workin' - but I can't concentrate. I oughta be sleepin' - 'steada stayin' up late. When I oughta be doing all the things I should do. I think about you. I oughta be writin' - but I can't find the song. Just sittin' here driftin' - driftin' along. There's only one thing that I wanna do. And that's think about you. I think about you - I can't get no rest. I think about you - there ain't no one else. It's all I can do - I can't help myself. Ya - I think about you. I could go cruisin' - but I've had enough. I could go drinkin' - but I can't stand the stuff. It just don't do me like it used ta do. I'd rather think about you. I think about you - I can't get no rest. I think about you - there ain't no one else. It's all I can do - I can't help myself. Ya - I think about you.
2662,Bryan Adams,Rock,She left her shoes out on the beach. she left my dreams just out of reach. she left her footprints in the sand. she was a bird right in the hand. I met a girl that made me laugh. she left a faded photograph. I thought I heard a siren song. I sang along but I was.... I was only dreamin'. I was only dreamin'. visions in my head. talkin in my sleep. turning in my bed. but I was only dreamin'. I met a girl that talked in rhyme. I met a girl who took her time. I saw the ocean in her eyes. I saw myself unrecognized. and all the stars up in the sky. fell down like rain and made me cry. I held the world right in my hands. I held her close but I was.... I was only dreamin'. I was only dreamin'. visions in my head. talkin in my sleep. turning in my bed. life was so complete. but I was only dreamin'. . I was only dreamin'. I was only dreamin'. visions in my head. talkin in my sleep. turning in my bed. life was so complete. her shoes were on the beach. but I was only dreamin'
2663,Bryan Adams,Rock,maybe i told you right from the start. you can have me. but you can't have my heart. it's easy enough to say but i couldn't care less. ya i mighta told you you were on my mind. guess i talked a pretty good line. but hey i can talk all day. but i just can't confess. that i'm a liar. i'm a victim of desire. i'm a moth into the fire. i'm over my head - forget what i said. tell ya i'm a liar. i'm just walking on the wire. i couldn't get much higher. i'm over my head - forget what i said. baby i'm a liar. when i told you i was hard to pin down. ya know i was just messin around. guess you know bynow that's just my way. and if you want some storeis - well i got a few. but hey - this is the truth i swear to you. how many more times do you want me to say.... if i told ya to go away. baby you can't believe a thing i say. listen.....
2664,Bryan Adams,Rock,I'm not the man you think i am. I'm not that kind of guy. Beneath this sleek exterior. There's less than meets the eye. I'm just what you've been looking for. Your wildest dream come true. I'm not the man you think i am. But i'm the man for you. I'm on important business. I'm late for my premiere. I'm doing you a favor. Just by being here. Surely you can buy a drink. For someone so renowned. I'm not the man you think i am. But i'm the man you've found. I'm burning with indifference. I'm sleeping with desire. I'm selling snow to eskimos. I'm preaching to the choir. My past is catching up to me. My chips are coming due. I'm not the man you think i am. But i'm the man for you
2665,Bryan Adams,Rock,Life - thin as a thread. Sometimes you're lucky. Sometimes you're better off dead. Your first breath is taken and in to the world you are cast. You long for tomorrow while living each day as your last. Well I know what your heart desires. But you can't take it with you. Into the fire. Now you've done all you can. Your life's at the crossroads. You watch as it slips through your hands. So stand on the mountain and shout in vain at the sky. But nobody hears you - the words only echo inside. Oh shelter the flame - it may expire. Risin' up from the ashes. Into the fire. Just hold on to your life down to the wire. Oh out from the dragon's jaws. Into the fire. There's a moment in every man's life. When he must decide what is wrong and what's right. You could wait for your dreams to come true. But time has no mercy. Time won't stand still for you. Well I know what your heart desires. Crawlin' out from the wreckage. Into the fire. Here I go...into the fire. I know...what your heart desires.
2666,Bryan Adams,Rock,"""I might as well bin blind. Thought I owned this world and all its time. Made up my mind not love again. Live my life a single man. Lady luck she came my way. Turned my night into day. She went huff and blew my little house down. She went puff ya she spun me around. She played rough ya she took me to town. All I did was fool around. And my whole world came tumblin' down. Is your mama gonna miss ya now your're gone?. Is your mama gonna miss her little rollin' stone?. Is mama gonna cry now she's alone?. Cause mama's little girl ain't goin' home!. Ya-she's goin' with me. I couldn't be found-couldn't be heard. You couldn't trap this free bird. I loved to fly shoulda heard me sing. You came along and flapped your wings. Had my eyes on the road foot on the floor. Tell me """"hey who's that knockin' at my door?"""". She went huff and blew my little house down. She went puff ya she spun me around. She played rough ya she took me to town. All I did was fool around. And my whole world came crumblin' down. Is your mama gonna miss ya now you're gone?. Is your mama gonna miss her little rollin' stone?. Is mama gonna cry now she's alone?. Cause mama's little girl ain't goin' home!. I said stop and she said go. Looks so good I can't say no. Now we've gone and lost control...."""
2667,Bryan Adams,Rock,It ain't a party - if you can't come 'round. You can drive the car - I'll play my ol' guitar. Come back to me - come back to me. Ya we can get some beer - ya let's get outta here. Come back to me - come back to me. We'll find a place to go - no one will ever know. Somewhere that's outta town. Put a blanket on the ground - baby. N' we can really go crazy. Babe it ain't a party - if you can't come 'round. Can't even get started - if you don't come down. Even Saturday - ain't a holiday - if you stay away. No - no it ain't a party - if you can't come 'round. Slip into somethin' tight - we'll slip into the night. Come back to me - come back to me.

And we can really go crazy. Babe it ain't a party - if you can't come 'round. Can't even get started - if you don't come down. Even Saturday - ain't a holiday - if you stay away. No - no it ain't a party - if you can't come 'round.
2668,Bryan Adams,Rock,Turn me loose it's now or never. feel like I could run forever. a new days come - a new moon's risin. I'll take my chances on the blue horizon. leap of faith - a shot of spirit. freedom's calling I can hear it. hold on tight were gonna get there. this time were on our way.

I have learned to fly - and hold my head up high. there's something I don't want you to forget. it ain't over yet - it ain't over yet. I was born to run - born to ramble. any price is worth the gamble. sometimes I get the urge to wander. cuz I'm a child of the wild blue yonder. it's in our hands - the sky's the limit. the race is on - we have to win it. hold on tight were gonna get there. it's time were on our way. How ya gonna know if you've got what it takes. you can't be a winner if you don't run the race. you know you get nothing if ya come second place. cuz it ain't over - until it's over
2669,Bryan Adams,Rock,Turned on the radio. Sounded like a disco. Musta turned the dial for a couple of miles. But I couldn't find no rock n' roll. This computerized crap ain't gettin' me off. Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock. London to LA. Talk about the New Wave. For a couple of bucks ya get a weird haircut. And waste your life away. Around the world or around the block. Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock. Get me my DJ. I got somethin' he's gotta play. Wanna hear it I can't wait. So turn it up - turn it up.... Kick down the barricades. Listen what the kids say. From time to time people change their minds. But the music is here to stay. I've seen it all from the bottom to the top. Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock. Around the world or around the block. Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock. Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock.
2670,Bryan Adams,Rock,Another day goes by and still you. wonder what happened. You'd give the world for one more try. But you're too shy to ask him. You don't wanna ask him now. I know your heart will pull you through. If he means that much to you -. you gotta let him know. Let him know that you love him. You gotta let him know. What can I say it's up to you. You gotta make up your own mind. Well it's your life it's up to you. Cause you didn't believe me. You still don't believe me. Now you're gonna see it's all comin' true. That's why I'm leavin' it up to you. Yeah you gotta let him know. The news is out I guess you heard. I shouldn't breathe a single word. The bottom line is nothing's gonna stop you now. You gotta let him know....
2671,Bryan Adams,Rock,From the edge of the city comes the sun. it makes you wanna turn your head around fills you. with desire sets both your feet on fire. how could you stand to be alone. how could you. stay at home so.... Let me take you dancin'. let me steal your heart tonight. let me take you dancin'. all night long. Strolling through an easy feel. through the motions that make it rock 'n real. You can learn to fake it. keep on trying. and you're bound to make it. It's gonna turn up upside down. it's gonna spin you 'round so. Let me take you dancin'. let me steal your heart tonight. Let me take you dancin'. let me make you feel alright.
2672,Bryan Adams,Rock,Everywhere I go all the places that I’ve been. Every smile is a new horizon on a land I’ve never seen. There are people around the world -. different faces different names. But there's one true emotion that. reminds me we're the same.... Let's talk about love. From the laughter of a child to the tears. of a grown man. There's a thread that runs right through us. all and helps us understand. As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker. to a flame. From the very first sweet melody to the. very last refrain.... Let's talk about love. Let's talk about us. Let's talk about life. Let's talk about trust. Let's talk about love. It's the king of all who live and the. queen of good hearts. It's the ace you may keep up your. sleeve - till the name is all but lost. As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm. But as gentle as a falling leave on any autumn morn.... Chorus. Let's talk about love - it's all we're needin'. Let's talk about us - it's the air we're breathin'. Let's talk about life - I wanna know you. Let's talk about trust - and I wanna show you. Let's talk about love
2673,Bryan Adams,Rock,Who are you to say that I am wrong?. Who are you to say I'm crazy?. Ain't a crime of passion comin' on strong. I'm only trying to treat ya like a lady. And I can't Help myself. Do I have to prove my innocence?. Don't need a lawyer with a fat degree. Cause if lovin' you is against the law. Then you better lock me up and throw away the key. Oh gonna take it to the jury. Oh gonna nail it to the wall. Oh gonna fight I'm gonna prove it. Oh so let the hammer fall. I'm not guilty-baby I'm not. I can't stop this feeling' I got. I'm not guilty-cross my heart.

It's a sticky situation
2674,Bryan Adams,Rock,This is story about a boy and girl. Trying find a life in the big world. Somehow they're together. There ain't much to the mystery. Misery loves company. She just waves her hand and says whatever. Well this ain't love this ain't love this ain't love at all and he says.... We're not romeo we're not juliet. How long does it take to fill this emptyness. We're just two lost souls and baby we got no regrets. We don't wanna say bye-bye. Babe it's just you and i. We're not romeo we're not juliet. He ain't pretty with his hard old heart. Second generation immigrant scars. And he knows that this ain't heaven - no. She's all skinny like a cigarette. And he's the only thing - the only thing that she respects. And he's trying to make it better. This ain't love this ain't love this ain't love at all. And she says.... We're not romeo we're not juliet. You'd thought you'd seen it all - but you ain't seen nothin' yet. We're just two lost souls and baby we got no regrets. Now it's just you and i. We're nothin' unless we try. We're not romeo - not juliet. It has feel right but it never does. It has to be perfect but it never is. You wanna be sure but you never do. We're not romeo - or juliet - it's just me and you. Ya it's just you and i. We're nothin' unless we try - oh no. We're not romeo - not juliet. No we're not - that's a fact
2675,Bryan Adams,Rock,Whenever I'm weary. From the battles that rage in my head. You make sense of madness. When my sanity hangs by a thread. I lose my way but still you seem to understand. Now and forever I will be your man. Sometimes I just hold you. Too caught up in me to see. I'm holding a fortune. That heaven has given to me. I'll try to show you each and every way I can. Now and forever I will be your man. Now I can rest my worries and always be sure. That I won't be alone anymore. And if only i'd known you were there all the time. All this time. Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand. Now and forever I will be your man. Now and forever I will be your man
2676,Bryan Adams,Rock,We're always on the run these days. We hardly have the time to say. What matters most of all. Ya you've always been the only one. The only one to make me run. Anytime you call. Let's not talk about the future. Let's not talk about the days gone past. All this time - we've been runnin' round in circles. I can feel a change a comin'. And i know we're gonna make it last. From now on - we'll be goin' somewhere slowly. Instead of going nowhere fast. When everything has come and gone. We'll look back on this road we're on. And see how far we've come (ya we've come a long way). Faster than the days go by. I know we're gonna make them last. Instead of goin' nowhere fast
2677,Bryan Adams,Rock,Free is all you gotta be. Dream dreams no one else can see. Sometimes ya wanna run away. But ya never know what might be comin' round your way. Ya ya ya. On a day like today. The whole world could change. The sun's gonna shine. Shine thru the rain. On a day like today. Ya never wanna see the sun go down. Ya never wanna see the sun go down. Somewhere - there's a place for you. I know that you believe it too. Sometimes if you wanna get away. All ya gotta know is what we got is here to stay. All the way. On a day like today - the whole world could change. The sun's gonna shine - shine through the rain. On a day like today - no one complains. Free to be pure - free to be sane. On a day like today. Ya never wanna see the sun go down. Ya never wanna see the sun go down. Free is all we gotta be. Dream dreams no one else can see. But ya never know what might be comin' for you and me. Ya it's gonna be. On a day like today.
2678,Bryan Adams,Rock,You're the silent type. And you caught my eye. But I never thought that I'd be touchin' you. How was I to know. I'd let my feelin's go. And that I'd be yours before the night was through. Chorus. One night love affair. Tryin' to make like we don't care. We were both reachin' out for somethin'. One night love affair. Pretendin' it ain't there. Oh - and now we're left with nothin'. When the mornin' breaks. We go our separate ways. If the night was made for love it ain't for keeps. But I lose control. As I watch you go. All my senses say I'm in this much too deep. Now you're outta reach. Chorus. Solo. Chorus.
2679,Bryan Adams,Rock,I'm sitting at the wheel. I got a green light. Not afraid of nothin' cuz heart and soul. I'm built for life. So let the engine roar. Push the pedal down.

2682,Bryan Adams,Rock,For our king and our country and the promise of glory. We came from Kingston and Brighton to fight on the front line. Just lads from the farms and boys from the cities. Not meant to be soldiers we lay in the trenches. We'd face the fighting with a smile - or so we said. If only we had known what danger lay ahead. The sky turned to grey as we went into battle. On the fields of Europe young men were fallin'. I'll be back for you someday - it won't be long. If I can just hold on 'til this bloody war is over. The guns will be silent on Remembrance Day. There'll be no more fighting on Remembrance Day. By October of 18 Cambrai had fallen. Soon the war would be over and we'd be returnin'. Don't forget me while I'm gone far away. Well it won't be long 'till I'm back there in your arms again. One day soon - I don't know when. You know we'll all be free and the bells of peace will ring again. The time will come for you and me. We'll be goin' home when this bloody war is ended. The guns will be silent on Remembrance Day. We'll all say a prayer on Remembrance Day. On Remembrance Day - say a little prayer. On Remembrance Day. Well the guns will be silent. There'll be no more fighting. Oh we'll lay down our weapons. On Remembrance Day.
2683,Bryan Adams,Rock,You don't know what you got - until you lose it. And I can testify that that's the truth. I had it all and didn't know how to use it. I was so stupid - it was right before my eyes. I've been looking all my life. Waiting for the perfect time. Never knew that I would find it. Right back where I started from. Why'd I have to go so far. When everything was where you are. How'd I know that you be waiting. Right back where I started from. Who can tell ya where the rivers flowin'. Just ride the wave - let it take ya down. All the twists and turns I navigated. It's so frustratin' you were there all the time. I've been looking all my life. Waiting for the perfect time. Never knew that I would find it. Right back where I started from. Why'd I have to go so far. When everything was where you are. How'd I know that you be waiting. Right back where I started from...oh where I started from. I know where I'm headed to - it's right back where I've been

2685,Bryan Adams,Rock,By: Igor Freitas. When a hotel room's the closest thing you got to home. You could be in Philadelphia you could even be in Rome. You gotta dial nine to get an outside line. I even need a concierge just to take a drive - it's a crazy life. I hope to see you smile - but I'm always wrong. It's a different melody but the same old song.... Ya I've been on the road nearly all my life. Been around the world 'bout a thousand times. Still a knock on the door makes me nervous. I think I'll see you standing there - but no. It's only room service - ya room service. I've been living out my suitcase as long as I remember. Life's the same - it doesn't change - it's a gibson or a fender. I still think about you babe - I swear sometimes I see your face. These are crazy days. Ya I think I hear your voice - but it's just a dream. It's a brand new movie but the same old scene. Ya I've been on the road nearly all my life. Been around the world 'bout a thousand times. Still a knock on the door makes me nervous. I think I'll see you standing there - but no. It's only room service - ya room service. Ya know I wouldn't change a thing - no. I'm just waiting for the bell in room to ring. I hope to see you smile - but I'm always wrong. It's a different melody but the same old song.... By Igor Freitas
2686,Bryan Adams,Rock,Instrumental
2687,Bryan Adams,Rock,Like a message in a bottle. Like a ship lost out at sea. I was sending out an Sos. That someone would rescue me. I was slowly goin' under. Singing like a stone. You reached out and showed me. That I wasn't all alone and I was saved. I was saved. I was saved. Baby I was saved. Love threw out a line. Oh I was saved. Well you washed me in forgiveness. Healed me with your touch. Such a beautiful redemption. Such a strong and simple love. Well I know it wasn't Jesus. That taught me to believe. It was the power of your sweet love. That brought me to my knees. Baby I was saved. I was saved. I was saved. I was saved. And love threw out a line and I was saved. Like mohammed to the mountain. Like a secret to the truth. I was searching for the answers. That I found inside of you. I was saved. I was saved. Deep down in my soul. I was saved. I was saved. I was saved. Love threw out a line. Just in time. Love threw out a line. And I was saved
2688,Bryan Adams,Rock,i'm tossing and turning and i can't get to sleep. got something on my mind - i just can't release. then she whispers so softly - that she believes in me. if i let her down - and tried to disguise it. she always see through it always replies that. no matter what i do - she believes in me. all the times i failed - gone slighty off the rails. she's there to remind me - she believes in me. when it all goes wrong and i feel i'm own. she's there to remind me - she believes in me. don't get me wrong - i not some kind of fool. i give her my world if she asked me to. cuz here's no denying - she believes in me. but i'm only human - i'm just a guy. that sometimes makes mistakes and i can't explain why. some say crazy - but she believes in me.
2689,Bryan Adams,Rock,"""""""She's A Little Too Good For Me"""". She got the brains - she got the looks. She knows all the right people - reads all the right books. She's got my name - she's got my number. But what she see's in me I sometimes wonder. She's a little too good for me. She's gonna change me if I let her. She's a little too good for me. But I'm getting better. I'm just a guy - I'm just me. I'm happy with my feet up on the table - in front of my TV. We're world's apart - we're night and day. She's dinner by candle light - I'm just a take-a-way. She's a little too good for me. She's gonna change me if I let her. She's a little too good for me. But I'm getting better. She's says I do something to her. All her friends say I'm a loser"""
2690,Bryan Adams,Rock,"""Monday mornin' - it's time to get up. Two cups of coffee and she runs for the bus. Looks in the window and fixes her hair. Nobody notices and nobody cares. She admits it ain't no kinda life. Workin' 9 to 5 you know.... She's only happy when she's dancin'. There ain't no place she'd rather be. When she's dancin'. Just her heart and her soul and her fantasies. When Friday evenin' finally rolls around. She grabs a taxi and she heads uptown. Goes to a place they call """"The Ball And Chain"""". Nothin' matters until Monday so she goes insane. Well it's a bitch tryin' to make ends meet. But that's the way the story goes. She's only happy when she's dancin'. There ain't nothin' makes her feel so free. When she's dancin'. The girl's outrageous and it's plain to see. Solo. She ain't got much but she got independence. Ya - she's doin' alright. His eyes are on her as the evenin's endin'. But she ain't goin' for no mystery. Because nobody rides for free. She's only happy when she's dancin'. Dancin' - there ain't no place she'd rather be. When she's dancin'. Just her heart and her soul and her fantasies - dancin'."""
2691,Bryan Adams,Rock,it's funny what goes through your mind. when you think of times you spent together. funny but when i think back why we broke up. the reasons seem so small. one day she's with me everything's fine. sayin' somethin' sounded like I love you. the next week i see her walkin' down the street with someone else. probably sayin' the same thing. it's doin' my brain in.... i got nothin - goin' nowhere. tired of under achieving. i keep searchin' - nothin's workin'. it's not enough just to be breathin'. i need somethin' to believe in. it's funny what goes on in your head. when you think about the way things come together. but now i think back why things had to change. the reasons seem so small. cruel twist of fate keepin' me awake. when i need to sleep to take away the hurtin'. but now i got time on my hands tryin' to understand. but there ain't no explainin'. it's doin' my brain in.... .

2692,Bryan Adams,Rock,Words and music by Adams and Gaudin. This is a song for a star. If you really are a star. Here is a song for you all. Take a lesson before you fall. Weâ€™re caught in the middle of everything. Itâ€™s like trying to figure out which bell to ring. You think youâ€™d made the start of it. But this is just the start of it now. Steppinâ€™ in time with your pace. Thoâ€™ weâ€™ve never yet met face to face. This is a song for yourself. In the hopes that we donâ€™t do it wrong. Weâ€™re caught in the middle of everything. Lookinâ€™ and turninâ€™ out songs to sing. It couldâ€™ve been the start of it. But this is just the start of it now. You can be a star if you can climb. Just make sure you are in the nick of time. This is a song for a star (song for a star). This is a song for a star (song for a star). This is a song for a star. If you really are a star. This to whoever you are. If you really are a star.
2693,Bryan Adams,Rock,Sound the bugle now. Play it just for me. As the seasons change. Remember how I used to be. Now I can't go on. I can't even start. I've got nothing left. Just an empty heart. I'm a soldier. Wounded so I must give up the fight. There's nothing more for me. Lead me away.... Or leave me lying here. Sound the bugle now. Tell them I don't care. There 's not a road I know. That leads to anywhere. Without a light I fear that I will. Stumble in the dark. Lay right down. Decide not to go on. Then from on high. Somewhere in the distance. There's a voice that calls. Remember who you are. If you lose yourself. Your courage soon will follow. So be strong tonight. Remember who you are. Yeah. You're a soldier now. Fighting in a battle. To be free once more.... Yeah that's worth fighting for
2694,Bryan Adams,Rock,I could start dreamin' but it'd never ends. As long as you're gone we may as well pretend. I've been dreamin'. Straight from the heart. You said it's easy but who's to say. That we'd be able to keep it this way. But it's easier. Comin' straight from the heart. Give it to me straight from the heart. Tell me we can make another start. You know I'll never go - as long as I know. It's comin' straight from the heart. I'll see you on the street some other time. And all our words would just fall outta line. While we're dreamin'. Straight from the heart. Give it to me straight from the heart. Tell me we can make one more start. You know I'll never go - as long as I know. It's comin' straight from the heart
2695,Bryan Adams,Rock,I shoulda seen it coming. I shoulda seen the signs. Didn't really think that she needs me. Must've 'bin blind. She didn't give me a warning. Said I shouldn't treat you wrong. But when I woke up this mornin'. She was gone gone gone. She said.... Take me back won't ya. Take me back won't ya. I'll change my ways. Take me back won't ya. Take me back won't ya. I'm not the same. She didn't tell me about it. Am I supposed to read your mind. You make me get up and shout it. It's a crime crime crime. I shoulda seen it coming. I shoulda seen the signs. Didn't really think that she needs me. Must've 'bin blind. She said.... Take me back won't ya. Take me back won't ya. I'll change my ways. Take me back won't ya. Take me back won't ya. I'm not the same. Won't ya take me back. Won't ya take me back.
2696,Bryan Adams,Rock,Just a small town girl in the city lights. The best was yet to come. Then lonely days turned to endless nights. The best was yet to come. How were you to know. That you would be the lucky one. Ain't it funny how time flies. When the best was yet to come. You can cry yourself to sleep at night. You can't change the things you've done. You had it there then it slipped away. Yeah you left the song unsung. Even through your tears. I never saw you come undone. What's so good about goodbye. When the best was yet to come. I find myself thinkin' about yesterday. When you were here and livin' in a dream. In the moment that it takes. You find you made your first mistake. Like the setting sun.... You turn around it's gone. Just a small time girl who had it made. Or so the story goes. She had it there then it slipped away. Oh - how was she to know. Even through her tears. I never saw her come undone. Ain't it funny how time flies. When the best was yet to come. What's so good about goodbye. When the best was yet to come.
2697,Bryan Adams,Rock,Instrumental
2698,Bryan Adams,Rock,Well I made up my mind. Not gonna let you get away. To think that I'm the lucky guy. I've almost got it made. Cause it's been so long. Since I've felt so strong. About anyone at all. I get so excited. I ain't gonna fight it. I think I might be fallin' in love. So come on - let's get it right. Cause you're the only one. So come on - we ain't got all night. Cause you're the only one. Last night. I thought you mighta stayed. If I'd a' had the guts. I woulda pushed my luck. But then you mighta turned away. How do I explain. I know it sounds insane. But then I've been through this before. In just a matter of time. You could change your mind. You could turn and walk right hrough that door. So come on - let's get it straight. Cause you're the only one. So come on - I just can't wait. Cause you're the only one.
2699,Bryan Adams,Rock,I don't look good in no Armani Suits. No Gucci shoes - or designer boots. I've tried the latest lines from A to Z. But there's just one thing that looks good on me. (Chorus). The only thing I want. The only thing I need. The only thing I choose. The only thing that looks good on me... is you. I'm not satisfied with Versace style. Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file. Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good. But there's only one thing that fits me like it. should. (Chorus). The only thing I want. The only thing I need. The only thing I choose. The only thing that looks good on me... is you. Ya it's you - it could only be you. Nobody else will ever do. Ya baby it's you - that I stick to. Ya we stick like glue. (Chorus). The only thing I want. The only thing I need. The only thing I choose. The only thing that looks good on me... is you
2700,Bryan Adams,Rock,People say I'm the life of the party 'cause I tell a joke or two. Although I might be laughing loud and hearty. Deep inside I'm blue. So take a good look at my face. You'll see my smile looks out of place. If you look closer it's easy to trace. The tracks of my tears. I need you. Need you. Since you left me if you see me with another girl. Seeming like I'm having fun. Although she may be cute she's just a sustitute because. You're the only one. So take a good look at my face. You'll see my smile looks out of place. If you look closer it's easy to trace. The tracks of my tears. I need you. Need you. Hey hey. I'm masquerading. My hope is fading. Oh yeah since you put me down. My smile is my makeup I wear since my breakup with you. Baby take a good look at my face. You'll see my smile looks out of place. If you look closer it's easy to trace. The tracks of my tears. So take a good look at my face. You'll see my smile looks out of place. If you look closer it's easy to trace. The tracks of my tears
2701,Bryan Adams,Rock,i don't wanna be no soldier - i don't wanna shoot no gun. i don't wanna drop no bomb - i don't wanna hurt no one. i don't wanna fight no battles - i don't wanna settle no score. i don't even understand - what we're fightin for. no it ain't my war. that's the way of the world - that's what they tell me. that's the way of the world - they can't sell me. that's the way of the world - i can't explain it. that's the way of the world - but we can change it. we're burnin up the ozone layer - we're walkin on a real thin wire. stirrin up a hurricane - playin with the devil's fire. we got a lot of dirty water - we got a lot of dirty air. got skeletons in the closet - but nobody looks in there. cuz they're all scared. chorus. i just wanna live in peace now - with my guitar and my girl. raise a little family - that's way it's supposed to be. that's the way of the world. that's the way of the world. .

2702,Bryan Adams,Rock,I hear the wind across the plain. A sound so strong. that calls my name. It's wild like the river. it's warm like the sun. Ya it's here. this is where I belong. Under the starry skies. where eagles have flown. This place is paradise. it's the place I call home. The moon on the mountains. The whisper through the trees. The waves on the water. Let nothing come between this and me. Cuz everything I want. is everything that's here. And when when we're all together. there's nothing to fear. hmm.. hmm.. ooh.. And wherever I wander. the one thing I've learned. It's to here. I will always....always return
2703,Bryan Adams,Rock,Love is forever-as I lie awake. Beside you. I believed-there's no heaven. No hideaway-for the lonely. But I was wrong-crazy. It's gotta be strong. It's gotta be right. Only wanted to stay awhile. Only wanted to play awhile. Then you taught me to fly like a bird. Baby-thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Such a night I never had before. Thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Cause what I got there ain't no cure for. Ooo it gets better. It's what you do to me all night angel. I never loved-swear to God. Til you came along I never felt this strong. Here I come baby. It's gotta be strong-it's gotta be right. Only wanted to stay awhile. Only wanted to play awhile. Then you taught me to fly like a bird. Baby-thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Such a night I never had before. Thought i'd died and gone to heaven. Cause what I got there ain't no cure for. I feel fast asleep-I feel drunk. I dream the sweetest dreams. Never wanna wake up. Never thought it could be this way. No doubt about it-can't live without it. Never thought it could be this good. You made love to me-the way it oughta be
2704,Bryan Adams,Rock,The more I get to know ya - nothin´ can compare. with all of my heart - ya know I´ll always be - right there forever - we will be together - just you and me. the more I get to know ya - the more I really care with all of my heart - ya know I´ll always be.... ya know I really love ya - ya nothin´can compare for all of my life - ya know I´ll always be - right there.
2705,Bryan Adams,Rock,Stand up - if ya wanna fight. I'm tellin' all the women - stand up for your rights. If ya wanna wear the trousers - you wanna act like a man. I'd love to trade ya places - love to be your thang. I'd do all the shopping - collect you favorite suit. Press all the laundry - polish all your boots. And if you brought me flowers - I'd meet you at the door. Have your dinner ready - your slippers on the floor. And when day turns to night and you feel alright. And I turn out the lights. Touch the hand of the man who'll make ya woman. Touch the hand of the man who'll make it right. Touch the hand of the man who'll make ya woman. Cause when day turns to night and you feel alright. And I turn out the lights. Stand up - it's alright. Love to play the woman - love to play your wife. Light you favorite cigarette - pour your favorite drink. Wear your best apron - wash the dishes in the sink. Get your shaving lotion - turn the shower on. Warm up your bathrobe - keep my baby warm. Read ya bedtime stories - while you take a nap. Turn on the TV - put out the cat. But when day turns to night and you feel alright. And I turn out the lights...
2706,Bryan Adams,Rock,People all over build on solid ground. They build it up and then they tear it down. Take it or leave it who cares how much it costs. They'll never know how much is gone until it's lost. 'til it's vanishing. Think I hear thunder ain't no sign of rain. Danger signs flashin' in my brain. Ridin' on empty-lights are turnin' red. There ain't no lovin' left in this empty bed. Ya it's vanishing. We're sittin' on treasure call it sacred ground. Why look for more babe when it's right here to be found. Never gonna lose ya-ya know I'm gonna fight. This thing's worth saving girl-ya know we'll make it right. If it takes all night-gonna swim your sea. Gonna sail your ocean-gonna shake your tree. Gonna climb your moutain-gonna shine your light. Wanna row your river darlin'-if it takes all night. People all over build mansions in the sky. They choke on smoke and watch their dreams go by. When the phone stops ringin' love has surely died. But the grass is greener babe on the other side. Never wanna lose ya-ya know I'm gonna fight. Never said it'd be easy girl-ya know we'll make it right. If it takes all night-gonna swim your sea. Gonna sail your ocean-gonna shake your tree. Gonna climb your moutain-gonna shine your light. Wanna row your river darlin'-if it takes all night. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone. Whatcha gonna do without a shoulder to lean on. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone. Never wanna lose ya-ya know we gotta fight. Never said it'd be easy girl-ya know we'll get it right.... If it takes all night.
2707,Bryan Adams,Rock,Livin' on your own can be a lonely game. A face in the crowd - no one knows your name. Itâ€™s a table for one and a broken heart to go. She's the kind of lover that you always dreamed. Would come to stay and never wanna leave. But that's all changed - she's dealt the final blow. Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of. Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love. It doesn't matter who was right or wrong. When the fire is over - when the magic's gone. You pick up the pieces and do the best you can. It knocks you down but you try it again. You get a little older it's a cryin' shame. Sometimes things don't work out like you plan. Who's gonna help when you've had enough. It ain't no secret you're a victim of love. Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of. Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love. One goodbye was really all it took. Now you thumb through the pages of your little black book. But somehow all the numbers look the same. You've been thinkin' how to get around it. But there ain't nothin' you can do about it. Nothin' ventured - nothin' gained. Ain't nothin' you can't rise above. Call it what you want but you're a victim of love. Who's gonna help you when you've had enough. Ain't no secret you're a victim of love. I don't wanna lose your love....

You'll deny the truth - believe a lie. There'll be times that you'll believe you can really fly. But your lonely nights - have just begun. When you love someone. When you love someone - you'll feel it deep inside. And nothin else can ever change your mind. When you want someone - when you need someone. When you love someone....

You'll shoot the moon - put out the sun. When you love someone

There´s nowhere to go from here. Standin´ here cold and shaken. How did I lose my way?. On this long lonely road that I´ve taken. Now that I´ve come to the end of the line. Now that I´ve run out of chanses. Evertyhing I love - has been left behind. And I don´t have the answers. Where do I go from here?. Standin´ here tired and broken. How do I find my way?. On this long lonely road where I´m goin´. It´s gonna be a long lonely road where I´m goin´. I´m gonna get there
2714,Bryan Adams,Rock,Was it some man that didn't treat you right. Left you reaching out for him in the middle of the night. Is there some heartache that you can't out run. That makes you so afraid to get close to anyone. You're so - easy to look at. You're so easy to hold. It's so easy to touch you - but so hard to let go. It's so easy to want you - that I can't get enough. Tell me why do ya have to be. Why do ya have to be so hard to love. Is it some hurt from long ago. That makes it so hard to let your feelings show. Is it the ghost of who you used to be. That makes you so afraid to bear your soul to me

I'M In Your Heart. You were told to run away. Soak the place and light the flame. Pay the price for your betrayal. Your betrayal (Your Betrayal). I was told to stay away. Those two words I can't obey. Pay the price for your betrayal. Your betrayal (Your Betrayal). Is it my turn to die?. My heart is pounding I say goodbye. So now I dance in the flames.

2719,Bullet For My Valentine,Rock,After all this time. You still couldn't recognise. That your problem lies within. In a vicious circle. Can you tell me why. Why you've thrown it all away. Cos it makes no sense to me. Why you wouldn't listen. Watching you decline. What were you expecting. I can't save you from yourself. When you don't want saving. It's on your head. Don't point the finger point the blame. Cos the warning signs were clear. You just wouldn't listen. I know it hurts. Tried to help to ease your pain. I know these words. They won't mean anything. I hope it hurts. You've only got yourself to blame. And I can't take this anymore. I'm over it. So over it. Breathe in breathe out. I feel it coming round again. Breathe in breathe out.

Your scent is poison when I breathe you in. It's there with every single breath I take. If this is it then don't resuscitate. I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time. I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine. It's on my skin. Your scent is poison when I breathe you in. I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time (for the very last time). Don't you speak. You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak. I guarantee I won't be losing sleep.

2723,Bullet For My Valentine,Rock,We've waited far too long to. Watch it all crash and fall through. So when you feel like shit you've gotta. Keep on pushing. If you saw the world through my eyes. Then you wouldn't feel so highrise. It's time to take our chance. You've gotta sit... Back... And hold tight.. There's Forces working in our heads. But we don't understand them. I need a map to find my way out all the time. There's Curses Lurking in our heads. But we don't want to find them. We need to come back down and face what we've become.. We've become.... The more I think. The more I wish I would stop and hit rewind. What I would give to have or take back then. When no-one really cares. I remember when we all used to. Kick back and take days off school.. So many times I'd smile. Many times I've cried. But never did we try. Never did we try.... Theres Forces working in our heads. But we don't understand them. I need a map to find my way out all the time. There's Curses Lurking in our heads. But we don't want to find them. We need to come back down and face what we've become.. It's haunting me... I'm so alone. I just want to find my way back home. I'm so alone.... Theres Forces working in our heads. But we don't understand them. I need a map to find my way out all the time.

2725,Bullet For My Valentine,Rock,Agony is the price. That you'll pay in the end. Domination consumes you. Then calls you a friend. It's a twisted fall. Binds are like steel. And manipulates the will to be. And it's hard to see. How soon we forget. When there's nothing else. Left to destroy. It's a useless ploy. Your eyes will see. The dawn of the day. And the writing. On the wall. Those words that stare. Into your soul. And to yourself. You will befall. It's domination pushed into living hell. Domination. A now blacked heart. Is reaching out in divinity. Body suspended by chains over razors. And nails it's a penalty. Each razor a vice and each nail. Marks the demise of you life.. Grim construction grows. Has life played a trick. Sealed you in brick by brick. Till your end forcing you to bend. Your eyes will see. The dawn of the day. And the writing. On the wall. Those words that stare. Into your soul. And to yourself. It's domination pushed into living hell. Domination.

2737,Capital Inicial,Rock,Ela dormiu no calor dos meus braços. E eu acordei sem saber se era um sonho. Algum tempo atrás pensei em te dizer. que eu nunca cai nas suas armadilhas de amor. Naquele amor. A sua maneira. Perdendo o meu tempo a noite inteira. Não mandarei cinzas de rosas. Nem penso em contar os nossos segredos. Naquele amor. A sua maneira.

2738,Capital Inicial,Rock,Só eu sei. Quantos invernos passei. Pra chegar aqui. Só eu sei. Há quantas estrelas caindo na terra. Eu pedi. Desertos gelados. Brinquedos quebrados. Em vidas que nunca vivi. Sorrindo de medo. Contando nos dedos. De quantas entradas saí. Pra chegar aqui. Pra chegar aqui. O mesmo céu. O mesmo mar. Um outro dia pra recomeçar. . Só eu vi. As longas estradas escuras. Que atravessei. Só eu vi. Por quantas esquinas e portas fechadas. Eu passei. Planeta sem vida. Inocência perdida. Mentiras que acreditei. (?). Lembrando aos poucos. Em quantas saídas entrei. Pra chegar aqui. Pra chegar aqui. O mesmo céu. O mesmo mar. Um outro dia pra recomeçar. . Só eu sei. Quantos invernos passei. Pra chegar aqui. Só eu sei. Há quantas estrelas caindo na terra. Eu pedi. O mesmo céu. O mesmo mar. Um outro dia pra recomeçar
2739,Capital Inicial,Rock,Cai a noite na cidade. Vinda de lugar nenhum. E o dia vai embora. Indo pra lugar algum. Não sentia fome. Não sentia frio. Sentado num canto. De um quarto vazio. Quando a chuva cai. Nas noites mais solitárias. Lembre-se que sempre.... Sombras e pensamentos. De um sonho só esperança. Nas paredes ecoavam. O silêncio e a lembrança. Entre ruas desertas. Ele está só de passagem. Na vertigem e tontura. Surgiam todo tipo de imagens. Quando a chuva cai. Nas noites mais solitárias. Lembre-se que sempre. Estarei aqui. Se virou e alcançou o céu. E a última estrela. Nada deixava passar. Tudo lembrava ela
2740,Capital Inicial,Rock,Eu não sei o que eu to fazendo mas tenho que fazer. Naquela noite que eu te conheci eu acho que nunca vou esquecer. Um momento quase perfeito inocente em seus defeitos. Tudo que é bom dura pouco e não acaba cedo.. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.. Eu disse vamo embora to meio tonto. Preciso respirar lá fora. Me leve para sua casa. Eu quero dormir onde você mora. Eu passando mal e você ria. Tanto barulho eu não entendia. Mas concordava sem saber. Com tudo que você dizia.. Se me pedisse pra pular de um prédio. Eu diria sim. Qualquer coisa pra você gostar de mim.. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.. Eu perdi o rumo e comecei a delirar. Acho que prometi até parar de beber e de fumar. De repente a noite acaba e todo mundo some. Eu me lembrei que eu esqueci de perguntar o seu nome. Sem endereço nem direção por onde começar. Qualquer coisa pra poder te encontrar. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.. Eu não como eu não rio. Eu não sei o que é adormecer. Me desculpe se eu fechar os olhos e. Desaparecer. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.
2741,Capital Inicial,Rock,Ninguém nunca te disse. Como ser tão imperfeito. Você tem tão pouca chance. De alcançar o seu destino. É fácil fazer parte. De um mundo tão pequeno. Onde amigos invisíveis. Nunca ligam outra vez. Talvez até porque. Ninguém ligue pra você. Se você quer. Que eu feche os olhos. Pra alguém que foi viver. Algum dia lá fora. E nesse dia. Se o mundo acabar. Não vou ligar. Pra aquilo que eu não fiz. Faz muito pouco tempo. Aprendi a aceitar. Quem é dono da verdade. Não é dono de ninguém. Só não se esqueça que atrás. Do veneno das palavras. Sobra só o desespero. De ver tudo mudar. Talvez até porque. Ninguém mude por você. Se você quer. Que eu feche os olhos. Pra alguém que foi viver. Algum dia lá fora. E nesse dia. Se o mundo acabar. Não vou ligar. Pra aquilo que eu não fiz. Talvez até porque. Ninguém mude pra você. Se você quer. Que eu feche os olhos. Pra alguém que foi viver. Algum dia lá fora. E nesse dia. Se o mundo acabar. Não vou ligar. Pra aquilo que eu não fiz. . * versão ao vivo
2742,Capital Inicial,Rock,Parece que o tempo parou. Cansado de lugares comuns. Um truque barato. Pra maiores de 21. Saber do que gosta. Sem gostar de tudo que se sabe. Parece que estamos perdidos. Sem saber o que dizer. Quem matou John Kennedy. Quem descobriu o Brasil. As melhores coisas. Se aprendem na escola. Mas não na sala de aula. Não na sala de aula. Não sobrou nada a não ser. Sair pra dançar. Até gastar os sapatos. Cintos de segurança. Se por acaso anoitecer. O que é raiz quadrada. Onde fica a África do Sul. As melhores coisas. Se aprendem na escola. Mas não na sala de aula. Não na sala de aula. O que é raiz quadrada?. Onde fica a África do Sul?. Quem inventou a bomba atômica?. E por quem os sinos dobram?. As melhores coisas. Se aprendem na escola. Mas não na sala de aula. Não na sala de aula. Parece que o tempo parou. Cansado de lugares comuns. Um truque barato. Pra maiores de 21 ...

Naquele amor. A sua maneira. Perdendo o meu tempo a noite inteira. Não mandarei cinzas de rosas. Nem penso em contar os nossos segredos. Naquele amor. A sua maneira. Perdendo o meu tempo a noite inteira. Ela dormiu no calor dos meus braços. E eu acordei sem saber se era um sonho. Há um tempo atrás pensei em te dizer. que eu nunca cai nas suas armadilhas de amor. Naquele amor. A sua maneira. Perdendo o meu tempo a noite inteira. Naquele amor. A sua maneira. Perdendo o meu tempo a noite inteira
2746,Capital Inicial,Rock,A noite me leva pra rua. Promete o que eu quero. E toma o que eu tenho. Promessas fazem o meu sangue ferver. E o asfalto queimar. Mas atravesso com os olhos fechados. Só a luz da rua como testemunha. É tão calmo por aqui. Quando eu me rendo às suas promessas. Esqueço tudo que tem gosto amargo. O tempo não passa. Quando falo sozinho. Ninguém sabe onde estou. Nem pra onde eu vou. Mas se tudo der errado. Eu quero estar do seu lado. Dançando à beira do precipício
2747,Capital Inicial,Rock,Ninguém nunca te disse. Como ser tão imperfeito. Você tem tão pouca chance. De alcançar o seu destino. É fácil fazer parte. De um mundo tão pequeno. Onde amigos invisíveis. Nunca ligam outra vez. Talvez até porque. Ninguém ligue pra você. Se você quer. Que eu feche os olhos. Pra alguém que foi viver. Algum dia lá fora. E nesse dia. Se o mundo acabar. Não vou ligar. Pra aquilo que eu não fiz. Faz muito pouco tempo. Aprendi a aceitar. Quem é dono da verdade. Não é dono de ninguém. Só não se esqueça que atrás. Do veneno das palavras. Sobra só o desespero. De ver tudo mudar. Talvez até porque. Ninguém mude por você. Se você quer. Que eu feche os olhos. Pra alguém que foi viver. Algum dia lá fora. E nesse dia. Se o mundo acabar. Não vou ligar. Pra aquilo que eu não fiz. Talvez até porque. Ninguém mude pra você. Se você quer. Que eu feche os olhos. Pra alguém que foi viver. Algum dia lá fora. E nesse dia. Se o mundo acabar. Não vou ligar. Pra aquilo que eu não fiz. . * versão ao vivo
2748,Capital Inicial,Rock,Um arrepio me congela os ossos. Que vontade de poder dizer o que eu sinto. Que vontade de poder. Luzes da cidade ofuscam a minha vista. Luzes da cidade ofuscam a verdade. Por favor me diga o que será melhor. Eu não tenho mais nenhuma condição. Me dê ao menos uma boa razão
2749,Capital Inicial,Rock,São duas horas. Da madrugada. De um dia assim. Um velho anda. De terno velho. Assim assim. Quando aparece o Guarda Belo. É posto em cena. Fazendo cena. Num treco assim. Bem apontado. Ao nariz chato. Assim assim. Quando aparece a cor do velho. Mas Guarda Belo. Não acredita. Na cor assim. Ele decide. No terno velho. Assim assim. Porque ele quer um velho assado. Mas mesmo assim. O velho morre. Assim assim. E o Guarda Belo. É o herói. Assim assado. Porque é preciso ser assim assado
2750,Capital Inicial,Rock,Vou denunciar autoridades incompetentes. Eu vou denunciar autoridades incompetentes. Eu quero antes te dizer. Ninguém sabe o que pode te acontecer. Eu quero antes te dizer. Ninguém sabe o que pode te acontecer. Vou denunciar autoridades incompetentes. Eu vou denunciar autoridades incompetentes. Ameaça aos privilégios. Você será detido encostado na parede. É a ordem no progresso. Um jogo imoral. Que não mede consequências. Autoridades incompetentes. Acham que vocês não passam de fantoches. Bonecos para brincar. Bonecos para brincar. Autoridades incompetentes. Sabem que vocês estão em fila. A fila não incomoda. A fila não incomoda. A fila não incomoda
2751,Capital Inicial,Rock,Belos e malditos. Feitos para o prazer. Os últimos a sair. Os primeiros a morrer. Belos e malditos. Eles ou ninguém. De carne quase sempre. São anjos para alguém. São anjos para alguém.... (vocalização). Suave é. Suave é. A noite é. De bar em bar. De bar em bar. De bar em bar. Belos e malditos. Culpados por viver. Num mundo feito de tédio. Cego para o poder. Belos e malditos. Drama e carnaval. O lado escuro do paraíso. O bem que vem do mal. O bem que vem do mal.... (vocalização). Suave é. Suave é. A noite é. De bar em bar. De bar em bar. De bar em bar.... Eles brincam com fogo. Sabem queimar. Eles brincam com fogo. Sabem queimar.... Eles brincam com fogo. Sabem queimar. Eles brincam com fogo. Sabem queimar.... Suave é. Suave é. A noite é. De bar em bar. De bar em bar
2752,Capital Inicial,Rock,Aborto Eletrico-Æ. . *Letra Proibida*. . Não tenho mais dinheiro. Nem pra perna nem pra quina. Só tenho 20 mangos. Pra comprar benzina. Fui até a farmácia. Eu e minha prima. Levei os 20 mangos. Pra comprar benzina. Benzina. Benzina. Benzina. Dentro do cinema. Eu tô com tudo em cima. Não vai pintar sujeira. Eu vou cheirar benzina. Não quero cocaína. Não quero benzadrina. Não quero heroína. Vou cheirar benzina. Benzina. Benzina. Benzina
2753,Capital Inicial,Rock,Cai a noite na cidade. Vinda de lugar nenhum. E o dia vai embora. Indo pra lugar algum. Não sentia fome. Não sentia frio. Sentado num canto. De um quarto vazio. Quando a chuva cai. Nas noites mais solitárias. Lembre-se que sempre.... Sombras e pensamentos. De um sonho só esperança. Nas paredes ecoavam. O silêncio e a lembrança. Entre ruas desertas. Ele está só de passagem. Na vertigem e tontura. Surgiam todo tipo de imagens. Quando a chuva cai. Nas noites mais solitárias. Lembre-se que sempre. Estarei aqui. Se virou e alcançou o céu. E a última estrela. Nada deixava passar. Tudo lembrava ela
2754,Capital Inicial,Rock,Não há muita semelhança. Entre o que você deseja. E aquilo que você alcança. Você acredita em algo maior. Alguma espécie de sentimento menor. Mas cavalheiros não se envolvem. É aí que está o perigo. Há tantas coisas que vejo nas ruas. E faço que não ligo. É claro que no fundo. Deste lado do muro. Continua como sempre foi. Há tantas coisas em que acredito. E nem sempre sigo. Mas acredite no que digo. Pior do que preconceito e leis. É alegar a igualdade. Por que nada se fez. É um engano acreditar. Que a abolição acabaria com a segregação. Se você se impressiona com Soweto. Experimente conhecer também os guetos daqui
2755,Capital Inicial,Rock,Se as nuvens ficam escuras. É porque vai chover. Se o céu está clareando. É que o sol vai nascer. Será que é tão difícil dizer aquilo que você sente. Será que você diz a verdade ou então você mente. Vê se assume o que você quer dizer. Eu já decidi o que eu quero fazer. Você não sabe muito bem onde ir. Não tente me confundir. Quer chuva? Deixa rolar. Afinal as nuvens estão ou não estão carregadas?. Você tem vontade de olhar mas não abre seus olhos. Você tem vontade de amar mas não abre seus braços
2756,Capital Inicial,Rock,Folhas verdes caem no jardim. Coisas que começam pelo fim. Como chuvas de verão. Caindo em outra estação. Aonde quer que eu vá. Ah ah ah um dia tudo volta para o seu lugar. Ah ah ah um dia vai ficar como devia estar. Vai ficar como devia estar. Prédios derretendo sob o céu. Sonhos construídos com papel. Carros vêm e vão. Correndo em minha direção. Aonde quer que eu vá. Ah ah ah um dia tudo volta para o seu lugar. Ah ah ah um dia vai ficar como devia estar. Vai ficar como devia estar. Como chuvas de verão. Caindo em outra estação. Aonde quer que eu vá. Ah ah ah um dia tudo volta para o seu lugar. Ah ah ah um dia vai ficar como devia estar. Vai ficar como devia estar. Ah ah ah um dia tudo volta para o seu lugar. Ah ah ah um dia vai ficar como devia estar. Vai ficar como devia estar
2757,Capital Inicial,Rock,Eu estou amaldiçoado. Por uma danação. Demo-lição na minha cabeça. Um trator no meu coração. Destruição. Perseguição sem fim. Eu quero esquecer. Que você existe. Pisar nas flores. Do seu jardim. Eu não sei. Como eu não consegui. Não matar você. O meio da rua. É o fundo do poço. A luz da janela. É o começo do vôo. No meio da luz. Eu só vejo o escuro. No fim da queda. Estarei livre de novo. Por Victor Teixeira (Aracaju - SE). victor_guitar_69@hotmail.com
2758,Capital Inicial,Rock,Dance animal dance. Dance pela distorção. Que sai da minha boca. Como balas de canhão. Dance animal dance. Dance com convicção. Dance animal dance. Com as mãos e com os pés. A rumba atômica. No volume 10. Dance animal dance. Feche os olhos faça um pedido. Quem sabe no final. Quem vence é o bandido. Tem um deserto no seu rosto. Tem um cacto na sua mão. Daqui eu posso ver o seu sorriso rachando. Ao mesmo tempo que o seu coração
2759,Capital Inicial,Rock,Ella durmió. Al calor de las masas. Y yo desperté. Queriendo soñarla. Algún tiempo atrás. Pensé en escribirle. Que nunca sorteé. Las trampas del amor. De aquel amor. De música ligeira. Nada nos libra. Nada mas queda. No le enviaré. Cenizas de rosas. Ni pienso evitar. Un roce secreto. De aquel amor. De música ligeira. Nada nos libra. Nada mas queda. Nada mas queda. Nada mas queda. Nada mas queda. by *lu*
2760,Capital Inicial,Rock,estamos colados. como cacos. de um vaso quebrado. desencontramos. na hora certa do dia errado. o que era muito. agora é muito pouco. somos perfeitos. desfeitos um pro outro. quem vai entender. tão iguais e diferentes. quanto eu e você?. quem vai entender. tão iguais e diferentes. quanto eu e você?. nunca brigamos. ao mesmo tempo. no mesmo espaço. inseparáveis. nos completamos. faltando um pedaço. o que era muito. agora é muito pouco. somos perfeitos. desfeitos um pro outro. quem vai entender. tão iguais e diferentes. quanto eu e você?. . (jefferson canesqui)
2761,Capital Inicial,Rock,Eletricidade. Ligação direta. Com certas partes. Do meu corpo. Eletricidade. Correntes alternadas. Bocas e quadris. Em alta velocidade. É só olhar. Que eu sinto a Terra tremer. É só tocar. Que voam fagulhas entre eu e você. Eu ouço sinos tocando. Eu vejo cidades queimando. Eu dou a volta ao mundo. Em menos de um segundo. Eletricidade. Fios descobertos. Cinco mil megawatts. Entre os meus braços. Eletricidade. Tensão e sobrecarga. Pólos opostos. Em eletroatividade
2762,Capital Inicial,Rock,Agora é você contra a multidão. Mas não se assuste se não for tão fácil. Você vai ter que demonstrar. Vai ter que provar a diferença. E por enquanto daqui de cima. Vocês parecem todos iguais. Quem tenta ser diferente. Apenas fica igual a todo mundo. O modelo na TV é tão sedutor. Faz parecer que o que você é. Não tem valor. Então você muda de cor. E pensa dessa vez você acertou. Mas que chato encontrar um vizinho. Vestido igual a você no elevador
2763,Capital Inicial,Rock,Eu não sei o que eu to fazendo mas tenho que fazer. Naquela noite que eu te conheci eu acho que nunca vou esquecer. Um momento quase perfeito inocente em seus defeitos. Tudo que é bom dura pouco e não acaba cedo.. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.. Eu disse vamo embora to meio tonto. Preciso respirar lá fora. Me leve para sua casa. Eu quero dormir onde você mora. Eu passando mal e você ria. Tanto barulho eu não entendia. Mas concordava sem saber. Com tudo que você dizia.. Se me pedisse pra pular de um prédio. Eu diria sim. Qualquer coisa pra você gostar de mim.. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.. Eu perdi o rumo e comecei a delirar. Acho que prometi até parar de beber e de fumar. De repente a noite acaba e todo mundo some. Eu me lembrei que eu esqueci de perguntar o seu nome. Sem endereço nem direção por onde começar. Qualquer coisa pra poder te encontrar. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.. Eu não como eu não rio. Eu não sei o que é adormecer. Me desculpe se eu fechar os olhos e. Desaparecer. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse adeus. Agora pra sempre. foi embora mas eu nunca disse.
2764,Capital Inicial,Rock,O sexo não te faz falta. Nenhuma droga te atrai. Você está sempre com calma. Você tem calma demais. Nós somos muito vivos. Não procuramos amigos. Nossos amigos já morreram. Lutando em outros conflitos. Mas não fiquem aflitos. Você não quebrará. A corrente que te prende a tua ilusão. A liberdade que você sente é acomodação
2765,Capital Inicial,Rock,Nas mãos não escondo nada. Meus bolsos estão vazios. Meus impulsos são controlados. Mas meus hábitos são obsessivos. As mãos que me tocam são geladas. As conversas que eu tenho são decoração. Parece que não há alternativa. Nessa vida de beco sem saída. Parece que não há alternativa. Preciso de uma forma mais ativa. (Refrão). Os dias passam. E nós estamos tão acostumados. A nos ver assim. Que já não nos interessa. Há anos preso nesse labirinto. Eu só conto com os meus instintos. Se eu não pensar em me acomodar. Talvez consiga me saciar. Pois já gritei aos céus. E já sussurrei ao mar. (2x). Só vou depor minhas armas. Por alguém que vale a pena lutar. (Refrão)
2766,Capital Inicial,Rock,Eu não quero mais viver. Eu não quero mais viver. Eu não quero mais viver. Eu não quero mais viver. Quero ser um vegetal. Quero ser um vegetal. Quero ser um vegetal. Quero ser um vegetal. Quero ser um vegetal. Nada. Não sinto nada. Não tenho nada. Não faço nada. Eu quero ser um vegetal. Cortar meus pulsos com uma gilete. Eu quero uma faca. Tomar comprimidos para dormir. E não acordar. Nada. Não vejo nada. Não ouço nada. Não espero nada. Eu não quero mais viver. Quero ser um vegetal. Nada. Não sinto nada. Não tenho nada. Não faço nada. Nada. Não quero nada. Não vejo nada. Nada. Não quero nada. . By cynthy@
2767,Capital Inicial,Rock,Eu sigo você aonde você for. Eu preciso de você pra aliviar a minha dor. Eu já estive aqui e ouço a sua voz. Me dizendo que há um oceano entre nós. Eu sigo você aonde você for. Eu preciso de você pra aliviar a minha dor. Te incomoda que eu fale assim?. O que mais você quer mudar em mim?. Te incomoda que eu fale assim?. O que mais você quer mudar em mim?. Você me quer. Incondicionalmente?. Ou me quer mais. Um pouco diferente?. Eu já estive aqui e ouço a sua voz. Me dizendo que há um oceano entre nós. Que tipo de poder te satisfaz?. Por que você quer que sejamos tão iguais?. Te incomoda que eu fale assim?. O que mais você quer mudar em mim?. Você me quer. Incondicionalmente?. Ou me quer mais. Um pouco diferente?. .
2768,Capital Inicial,Rock,Olhando o asfalto. Passando embaixo das minhas rodas. Enquanto os planos que eu tinha. Iam por água abaixo. O vento arrancando o medo. Do meu cabelo. Sentindo o tempo perdido. Correndo nas minhas veias. Agora eu vou ter que mergulhar. E aprender de novo a respirar (Bis). Ninguém está contente. Ninguém aqui é diferente. Ninguém é culpado. Ninguém aqui é inocente. O vento arrancando o medo. Do meu cabelo. Sentindo o tempo perdido. Correndo nas minhas veias. Amanhã tudo vai mudar. E achar um jeito de voltar (BIS). Ninguém...
2769,Capital Inicial,Rock,QUANDO OS DIAS SÃO SÓ DATAS NOS JORNAIS. E HORAS E MINUTOS SÃO IGUAIS. SE SEUS AMIGOS NÃO TE DIZEM NADA DEMAIS. QUANDO TUDO VIRA UM ENORME TANTO FAZ. É PRECISO CORAGEM. PRÁ RECUPERAR SEU INSTINTO SELVAGEM. E NÃO IMPORTA QUANTOS VÃO SE MACHUCAR. NÃO IMPORTA QUANTOS VÃO TE ESCUTAR. PODE ESPERAR QUE VAI CHEGAR A SUA VEZ. NADA NO MUNDO VALE O QUE VOCÊ ME FEZ. EU NÃO PRECISO GRITAR SÓ PRÁ VOCÊ ME VER. EU NÃO QUERO MUDAR SÓ PRÁ TE MERECER
2770,Capital Inicial,Rock,Fui enganado quando eu te conheci. Você disse que era simples e eu acreditei. Qualquer coisa te agradava. Agora eu me sinto meio amarrado. Assim não posso fazer nada. Eu preciso ganhar tempo. Eu só preciso ganhar tempo. Parecia tudo certo. Tudo que eu queria. Estava tão perto de acontecer. O tempo passa e você sabe o que ele faz. Tudo fica para trás. E você pediu demais. Você disse que detestava. Minhas roupas e meus discos. Mas mesmo assim eu estou quase certo. Que eu faria tudo de novo. Eu faria tudo de novo
2771,Capital Inicial,Rock,Você me faz pensar de mais. Sempre quando quero tentar. Ser só mais um que quer você!!. (refrão). Eu não consigo entender. Por que eu quero você?!. Eu não consigo entender!!. Você me faz deixar pra traz. Tudo que faz lembrar.... Como é viver sem ter você. (refrão). Eu não consigo entender. Por que eu quero você?!. Eu não consigo entender!!. Eu não sei mais voltar pra trás. Nunca pensei quero parar. De ser mais um que quer você!. (refrão). Eu não consigo entender. Por que eu quero você?!. Eu não consigo entender!!. Você me faz pensar de mais. Sempre quando quero tentar. Ser só mais um que quer você!!. (refrão). Eu não consigo entender. Por que eu quero você?!. (refrão). Eu não consigo entender. Por que eu quero você?!. (refrão). Eu não consigo entender. Por que eu quero você?!. (refrão). Eu não consigo entender. Por que eu quero você?!
2772,Capital Inicial,Rock,O mundo acaba. No Mambo Club. O céu desaba. E você dança. Vidros quebram. Paredes caem. Todos cantam. E não se cansam. Mais um sucesso. No Mambo Club. No ritmo das bombas. O passo do medo. Mais uma noite. No Mambo Club. É tudo falso. Mas aqui fora. É bem pior
2773,Capital Inicial,Rock,Eu tenho medo do mundo. Eu tenho medo do que pode acontecer. Eu to cansado de tudo. De tanto lutar e nunca vencer. A raiva que eu sinto. Vem das coisas. Que nós sabemos de cor. Quando eu vejo seu rosto. Eu quero ser melhor. Eu quero ser melhor. Pense no seu futuro. Essa conversa sempre me dá sono. Eu sou o rei da derrota. E me sinto pequeno. Aqui no meu trono. A dor do fracasso. Podia ser muito maior. Se eu não tivesse você. Pra me fazer melhor. A raiva que eu sinto. Vem das coisas. Que nós sabemos de cor. Quando eu vejo seu rosto. Eu quero ser melhor. Eu quero ser melhor
2774,Capital Inicial,Rock,Mark Rossi & Loro Jones). Há sempre alguma coisa. Que esquecemos de dizer. Os dias nunca são tão longos. Quanto poderiam ser. Acho que às vezes. Compreendo quando tentam me dizer. Tudo o que acaba. Antes de acontecer. É o que poderia ser. É o que poderia ser. São tantas faces diferentes. Vindo pela contramão. Os rostos se confundem. Como pegadas pelo chão. Mil vezes tentei te encontrar. Mas te perdi na multidão. Mil vezes tentei te encontrar. Nada justifica. Essa minha pressa de chegar. Todos os caminhos levam. Ao mesmo lugar. Pelas ruas. Cidade morta. Minha história excrevo. Por linhas tortas. Teu rosto me confunde. Teus olhos têm a cor da solidão. Mil vezes tentei te encontrar. Mas te perdi na multidão. Há sempre tantas coisas. Que deixamos de fazer. Noites... nunca tão longas. Noites... nunca tão longas
2775,Capital Inicial,Rock,Ouvi dizendo por aí. Que algo vai acontecer. Diante fica tão distante. De repente não quer mais me ver. Outra vez o último a saber. O que se passa. Talvez eu sempre faça a coisa errada. Um furacão pra mim é quase nada. De todos os desastres que eu podia. Eu escolhi você. Eu não sei por quê. Achei tudo tão difícil. O início já é meio fim. Corri o risco que eu sentia. Mas a sorte não sorriu pra mim. Mais do mesmo. Menos mal. Eu conheço a próxima cena. Um pouco de tristeza já me basta. Outro dia chega e se arrasta. Exatamente quando eu não queria. Eu conheci você. Eu não sei por quê
2776,Capital Inicial,Rock,Longe da confusão de fora. O momento perfeito. Parece estar aqui. E depois evapora. Longe da confusão de fora. Basta uma centelha. E pega fogo como gasolina. Conheço as noites do fim do mundo. Mas não consigo evitar. Palavras cruzam o ar e queimam. Não há como me esquivar. Por mais que eu tente. Me acertam em cheio. Por mais que eu tente. É como um carro sem freio. Noite e dia. O refrão é sempre assim. Noite e dia. Eu faço por você o que você fizer por mim. Eu faço por você o que você fizer por mim. Fizer por mim
2777,Capital Inicial,Rock,Longe da confusão de fora. O momento perfeito. Parece estar aqui. E depois evapora. Longe da confusão de fora. Basta uma centelha. E pega fogo como gasolina.

É como um carro sem freio. Noite e dia. O refrão é sempre assim. Noite e dia. Eu faço por você o que você fizer por mim. Eu faço por você o que você fizer por mim. Fizer por mim
2778,Capital Inicial,Rock,Você me procura. Sempre me persegue. Onde quer que eu vá. Eu sinto a sua mão. Tento me esconder. Esquecer a pressão. Não me permite um momento. Você me tortura. Assédio sem fim. Não há mais jeito. Nem chance de hesitação. Me entrego aos seus braços. Me estrague com seus laços. Faça de mim o que você quiser. Eu não posso evitar. Aberta eu deixo a porta. O devaneio se realiza. E a conseqüência não importa. Corroído pelo ácido. O limite é destroçado. Às corrtentes eu sucumbo. No calabouço o instinto é básico. Por Victor Teixeira (Aracaju - SE). victor_guitar_69@hotmail.com
2779,Capital Inicial,Rock,Você tem ódio nos seus olhos. E arrogância em todas palavras. Eu não pretendo julgar você. Eu não me sinto no direito. Eu faço o que eu quero. Mas eu nunca machuquei ninguém. Com tolas palavras. Por que nós não ficamos juntos. Por que não ficamos juntos. Não estou invadindo o seu espaço. Apenas reconquistando tudo aquilo que eu perdi. Tudo aquilo que me foi roubado. Mas parece que vou levar muito tempo. Por que nós não ficamos juntos. E tentamos resolver nossos problemas
2780,Capital Inicial,Rock,Ninguém pra ligar. E dizer onde estou. Ninguém pra ir comigo onde eu vou. Por outro lado. Ninguém pra abaixar o volume. Ninguém pra reclamar dos pratos sujos. Ninguém pra fingir que eu não amo. Toda noite no mesmo lugar. Eu abro os olhos. E vejo o dia entrar. Pra ninguém. Pra ninguém. Ninguém pra dizer quando eu devo parar. Ninguém na casa pra poder acordar. Do meu lado. Ninguém pra contar novidades. Ninguém pra fechar as cortinas. Ninguém pra brigar de vez em quando
2781,Capital Inicial,Rock,Projetos engavetados. São decisões congeladas. De pessoas decididas. Que se acham poderosas. E querem vê-los. Implementados. Qualquer dia implantados. No plexo do planalto. Em pleno vigor. Ocupando todo o espaço. Que julgar conveniente. Mesmo que desnecessário. A sub-comissão que debate. A regulamentação. Do ante-projeto. Carece de gabarito. Por ignorar a legislação. Suspendem a sessão. Retornam aos gabinetes. Consultal os assessores. Sobre as regras de conduta. Do protocolo de otimização. Do projeto engavetado. Qualquer dia implantado. No plexo do planalto
2782,Capital Inicial,Rock,Vejo seu retrato. Apenas uma imagem. A sombra de alguém. Viva porque vivo. Vivo nos seus sonhos. Lento pra te alcançar. Louco pra te amar. Setas indicando caminhos errados. Chegar só é possível de olhos vendados. Tento encarar os fatos. Você não é mais. Só existe um vazio me preenchendo. Dia após dia. Eu sinto a sua ausência. Tornando a minha vida. Sem sentido. Setas indicando caminhos errados. Chegar só é possível de olhos vendados
2783,Capital Inicial,Rock,Papai morreu. Mamãe também. Estou sozinho. Eu não tenho ninguém. Esta vida me maltrata. Estou virando um psicopata. Quebrei as janelas da minha casa. Rasguei a roupa da empregada. Esta vida me maltrata. Estou virando um psicopata. Quero soltar bombas no Congresso. Fumo Hollywood para o meu sucesso. Sempre assisto à rede Globo. Com uma arma na mão. Se aparece o Francisco Cuoco. Adeus televisão
2784,Capital Inicial,Rock,Lento como o tempo. Que não quer passar. Dorme pelos cantos. E me faz pensar. Certo como um corte. Que não quer doer. Olho pro espelho. Sem me conhecer. Vou fingir. Que nunca te vi. Vou viver. Sem ter onde ir. Até cansar. De respirar você. Até cansar. De respirar você. Alguma coisa errada. Quando um par são três. Uma vida inteira. Na primeira vez. Palavra por palavra. O que não quer dizer. Arde tanto a ponto. De enlouquecer. (BIS)
2785,Capital Inicial,Rock,Na rua 47. Os homens que passam. Sabem onde vão. Na rua 47. As mulheres que pensam. Sabem onde pisam. Na rua 47. Quem não sabe nada. Não faz porra nenhuma. Depois de um dia de merda. Eu estava a fim de diversão. E entreguei minha grana. Na mão de um irmão. Mas aqui a amizade. É irmã da traição. Nas sombras. Eu fui passado pra trás de novo. Não vou deixar barato a malhação. Pode parecer papo furado. Mas hoje não saio trapaceado. Na rua 47. Eu fui atrás do cara. Pegar o meu dinheiro. Na rua 47. Ele arriscou. E sacou primeiro. Na rua 47. Tem um corpo estendido no chão. Mas não é o meu!. . By Line_Vicious
2786,Capital Inicial,Rock,Sem direção. Sopra o vento. Sem direção. Sempre em movimento. Tudo é solidão. Que pensamentos passam pela sua mente. Em que direção você se move. Quem garante onde é a frente. Sem direção. Sopra o vento. O silêncio passa entre os dentes. O que não se toca só se sente. Eu não planejo o que faço. Não sei o meu próximo passo. Meu coração. Não bate lento. Como um tambor. Gritando impaciente. Às vezes o vento me faz esquecer. E eu sou carregado. Sem direção nem certeza. Levado pela correnteza. Sem direção. Sopra o vento
2787,Capital Inicial,Rock,Você já me viu sério. Já me viu de porre. Me viu fazendo drama. Pela sua desordem. Mas triste... Isso eu nunca quis. Que você visse. (refrão). Os meus olhos sentem. A falta dos seus. O meu corpo sente. A falta do seu. A minha alma. Sente a sua falta. Eu quis que nosso mundo fosse. Um conto de fadas. Amando o tempo todo. Em todo canto da casa. Mas isso... Hoje eu aprendi. Que não existe. (Refrão). Os meus olhos sentem. A falta dos seus. O meu corpo Sente. A falta do seu. A minha alma. Sente a sua falta. Mas nada vai fazer. Com quem eu desista. Nada é pra sempre. Eu sei que sou capaz. A vida não é isso. Ela é muito mais. Só tenho que dormir de novo. Pra sonhar de novo. . Anderson Maidecchi
2788,Capital Inicial,Rock,Só eu sei. Quantos invernos passei. Pra chegar aqui. Só eu sei. Há quantas estrelas caindo na terra. Eu pedi. Desertos gelados. Brinquedos quebrados. Em vidas que nunca vivi. Sorrindo de medo. Contando nos dedos. De quantas entradas saí. Pra chegar aqui. Pra chegar aqui. O mesmo céu. O mesmo mar. Um outro dia pra recomeçar. . Só eu vi. As longas estradas escuras. Que atravessei. Só eu vi. Por quantas esquinas e portas fechadas. Eu passei. Planeta sem vida. Inocência perdida. Mentiras que acreditei. (?). Lembrando aos poucos. Em quantas saídas entrei. Pra chegar aqui. Pra chegar aqui. O mesmo céu. O mesmo mar. Um outro dia pra recomeçar. . Só eu sei. Quantos invernos passei. Pra chegar aqui. Só eu sei.

A cada dia da ganância ]. Surge uma nova seita ]. E da falta de esperança ]. Aquele que cala e aceita ] REFRÃO. Se esperar é a questão ]. Dias melhores não virão ]. É hora de nós mesmos ]. Recolhermos os brinquedos do chão ]. A ameaça não é mais. Só um ataque nuclear. É a política de terra arrasada. Da espécie abençoada. É o instinto de destruição. Moldando o mundo a sua feição. Refrão
2792,Capital Inicial,Rock,Não pense que eu me importei. Por isso mesmo eu deixei. Acabar com tudo de uma vez. Pois entre nós só havia indiferença. Momentos cada vez mais frios. E você acha tudo normal. E agora eu nem sei. Mais uma vez acaba tudo mal. Quem sabe algum dia. Vamos entender o que passou. Descobrir quem foi que errou

2795,Capital Inicial,Rock,Outra história com um outro rosto. Um outro beijo com o mesmo gosto. Era cedo e não podia dar certo. Lá vem um outro dia frio e encoberto. Agora veja o meu estado. Olhando o futuro e prevendo o passado. Como alguém que não sabe o que quer. Mentindo pra todos enquanto puder. Gritar. Se foi um erro. Eu quero errar. Sempre assim. Gritar. Se teve começo. Que tenha fim. O tempo virou e me deu as costas. Outra pergunta com a mesma resposta. Os dias são sempre iguais. O mesmo filme em todos canais. Eu quero voar mas tenho medo de altura. O céu azul me dá tontura. Eu caio mas não chego ao chão. Estou certo mas perdi a razão. Gritar. Se foi um erro. Eu quero errar. Sempre assim. Gritar. Se teve começo. Que tenha fim. Vivendo e aprendendo a perder. Vivendo e aprendendo a esquecer. Vivendo e aprendendo a perder. Vivendo e aprendendo a esquecer. Gritar. Se foi um erro. Eu quero errar. Sempre assim. Gritar. Se teve começo. Que tenha fim

Pelos campos verdejantes a linguagem me faz levitar. Pena que não são a todos que a natureza toca. Pois da simples vida flui o maior milagre. Se caminhar é viver. Compartir é se doar. Quantas faltas vou viver. Antes de as expiar. Abandono essa riqueza suntuosa e cravejada. Com sandálias eu caminho a distância da jornada. Libertar é estar desperto à tentação que se instala. O poder só chama ao tolo que aceita a preguiça inata. Se caminhar é viver. Compartir é se doar. Quantas faltas vou viver. Antes de as expiar

2854,Counting Crows,Rock,Fading everything to black and blue. You look a lot like you. Shatter in the blink of an eye. You keep sailing right on through. Every time you say you're learning. You just look a lot like me. Pale under the blistering sky. White and red. Black and blue. Youâ€™ve been waiting a long time. Youâ€™ve been waiting a long time. To fall down on your knees. Cut your hands. Cut yourself until you bleed. Fall asleep next to me. Wait for everyone to go away. And in a dimly lit. room where youâ€™ve got nothing to hide. Say your goodbyes. Tell yourself weâ€™ll read. a note that says. Iâ€™m sorry everyone. Iâ€™m tired of feeling nothing goodbye. Wash your face. Dry your eyes. Cause youâ€™ve been waiting a long time. Youâ€™ve been waiting a long long time. To fall down on your knees. Cut your hands. Cut yourself until you bleed. But fall asleep next to me. Have a dream Iâ€™m falling down. On my face. Scrape my knees. Scrape my hands until they bleed. Cause you're fast asleep next to me. Next to me 3X.

The butterfly in reverse here is me. Maryann you're better than the world. They took a lot of time getting it right on this girl. I said Maryann you're better than the world. They did a lot of things right on this girl. Where'd you want to go to. with nothing beside you. But webbing and curfews and rain. And everything that hurts you. Gets stuffed up inside you. Like butterflies with wings. or other perfect things. We go swimming in the sunshine. Dangling from clotheslines. Seperate and fall into me. And did you ever see me. Me absolutely. Me but all you but still me. Maryann you're better than the world. They took a lot of time getting it right on this girl. I said Maryann you're better than the world. They did a lot of things right on this girl did alot of things right on this 2X. did alot of things right on this girl.

2860,Counting Crows,Rock,Sunday morning paper dated 1992. There are cowboys in my kitchen. empty bottles on the roof. I've been trying to quit these cigarettes. I've been trying to think its true. Maybe she's gone to California. maybe Ill go out there too. Daylight fading come and waste another year. all the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear. moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn. when she sees the early signs of daylight fading. she leaves just before its gone. Daddy's on the rooftop with his fingers in. the gun and I am waiting at the window I am. waiting for the one. Shying in that paper when she walked into my room. I said I want to say good-bye to you. Good-bye to all my friends good-bye to everyone I know. Daylight fading come and waste another year. all the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear. moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn. when she sees the early signs of daylight fading. she leaves just before its gone.

2861,Counting Crows,Rock,All I want is something good. It gets harder every time. She is leaving here tonight. Take a breath. Take your time. Spread your wings and rise. Make a mark upon the wall. Paint your face and pass the time. Close your eyes and she ascends. Hold your breath and ease your mind. Forty Thousand times. Time fades into the night. They descend and then they climb. Feathers falling through the night. Have you seen Ohio rise?. It has been four days and nights. All I want is something fine. It gets harder every time. She is sleeping far away. Take a breath. Take your time. Spread your wings and rise. Rise into the black Ohio skies.
2862,Counting Crows,Rock,She brings. Her friends. So we won't have. To be alone. A fear. That I might. Loose composer. Without warning. I am a child of fire. I am a liar. I have desire. But I was born inside. The sun this morning. This dirty life of mine. Is hangin' me up. Aall the time. This dirty life. Is just a hanging tree. This dirty life of mine. Is hangin' me up. All the time. This dirty life. Is just a haning tree. They say good evening. When they don't know. What to say. And they say good morning. We wish you would go home. You open windows. And you wait for someone. Warm to come inside. And then you freeze. To death alone. (Chorus). You call the waittress. But it's time for her to go. And shit I know. Everyone eventually leaving. But I got a pair of wings. For my birthday. And I will fall down. Through the sun. This evening. (Chorus)
2863,Counting Crows,Rock,On certain Sundays in November. When the weather bothers me. I empty drawers of other summer's. Where my shadows used to be. She is standing by the water. As her smile begins to curl. In this or any other summer. She is something all together different. Never just an ordinary girl. And in the evenings on Long Island. When the colors start to fade. She wears a silly yellow hat. That someone gave her when she stayed. I didn't think that she returned it. We left New York in a whirl. Time expands and then contracts. When you are spinning. In the grips of someone. Who is not an ordinary girl. When you sleep. You find your mother in the night. But she stays just out of sight. So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming. And when you wake the morning covers you with light. And it makes you feel alright. But it's just the same hard candy. You're remembering again. You send your lover off to China. Then you wait for her to call. You put your girl up on a pedestal. Then you wait for her to fall. I put my summer's back in a letter. And I hide it from the world. All the regrets you can't forget. Are somehow pressed upon a picture. In the face of such an ordinary girl. When you sleep. You find your mother in the night. But she fades just out of sight. So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming. And when you wake the morning showers you with light. And it makes you feel alright. But it's just the same hard candy. You're remembering again. Again 4X. It's just the same hard candy. You're remembering again. Again 4X. And it's just the same hard candy. You're remembering again. Go ask her to come around. And see me late after dark. Don't ask me to come around. Then wait to see if there's a spark..
2864,Counting Crows,Rock,Got a message in my head. that the papers had all gone. Richard Manuel is dead. And the daylight's coming on. I've been wandering through the dark. now I'm standing on the lawn. If I could give all my love to you. I could justify myself. but I'm just not coming through. You're a pill to ease the pain. of all the stupid things I do. I'm an anchor on the line. of a clock that tells the time. that is running out on you. Well it was cold when i woke. and the day was halfway done. Nearly spring in San Francisco. but I cannot feel the sun. you were sleeping next to me. but I knew that you'd be gone.

2868,Counting Crows,Rock,A picture of Amsterdam. Bare trees under glass. Framed. In the afternoon light. Of a winter long past. When I was a raiser. To Dublin I'd roam. She was a bareback rider. Some miles from home. Come back to me. She's a carnival driver. Hung in the sky. Cutting through time. Like a memory. Strung on a wire. The color of anything. Fades in the air. But she is the film. Of a book of the story. Of the smell of her hair. Come back to me. When every thing's over. And every thing's clear. When everyone's older. And no one is here. I try to remember. A girl on a wire. Tumbling and diving. Above Stephen's Green. Like a kite on the air. Come back to me

It makes it all withdraw. All the anger and loss. But it all keeps. Coming back. In the morning. You keep yourself. Too clean. You dig yourself. A dream. That we won't be. Coming home alone. Not this time (4x)

2873,Counting Crows,Rock,I sold my piano. It couldn't come with me. I locked up my bedroom. And I walked out into the air. When nothing I needed. Is left there behind me. I walk out through the shadows. Of Washington Square. Now I wander the highway. From Dublin to Berkeley. And I heard the songbirds. Of Valley Paurine. I love like a fountain. And it left me like nothing. Just the memories. Of walking through. Washington Square. Now I live in the shadows. Where light is electric. And time is just a number. That rests on a wall. Nobody knows me. My friends and my family. Are as far from this city. As Washington Square. So cover this warm night. In a blanket of starlight. I will follow this freeway. Out into the air. In case you should wonder. And wanted to find me. I'm traveling homeward. To Washington Square. In case you should wonder. I'm in Washington Square. Washington Square. Washington Square
2874,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,Hear the lonesome whippoorwill. His song's too blue to fly. The midnight train is a-winding low. I'm so lonesome I could cry. I've never seen a night so long. When time keeps crawling by. The moon is gone behind the clouds. To hide his face and cry. Have you ever seen a robin weep. When leaves have turned to brown?. Like me he's lost his will to live. I'm so lonesome I could cry. The silence of a falling star. Lights up a purple haze. and as I wonder where you are. I'm so lonesome I could cry.
2875,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,She captured both rock and bird. Tied one to the leg of the other. Kept them as prisoner. Till they knew who was master. Then she threw them to the sky. Bird with unbarred wings disappeared. Rock with weighted heart returned. And rock became her anchor. And bird became her dream. And now she stands on the forest floor. Among the pines and towering firs. Rock still firm beneath her feet. Bird perched high above her. Singing songs of love's betrayal. I offered you my endless skies. You countered with hoods and chains. This song I sing will be the last. To be inspired by your memory.

2884,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,No birds today. Just this square patch of gray. Molting sky moving in on its morning prey. No words today. No one knocking at the gate. I lost my name long before I lost my way. I wonder what he thinks out there. Pastures turn from black to green and black again. The sun it carves a well worn path. from here to there and the next day back. No birds today. Just this dull sky of gray. Winter's quickly moving in on its skulking prey. No dust today. No clouds rising from my driveway. No hope drifting slowly my way. I wonder what he thinks in there. Pastures turn from black to green and black again. The sun it carves a well worn path. from here to there and the next day back. Cold bars of steel. I'm beginning to dig the feel. of all that disappears into....ethereal. Cold words of hate. Now I'm seeing how things break. Much too late now to cure my mistakes. I wonder what he thinks in there. Pastures turn from black to green and black again. The sun it carves a well worn path. from here to there and the next day back. No birds today. Just this barren stretch of gray. Just this barren stretch of gray.

That your healing powers had grown. From a sore that's far far deeper. Than this heart where the pain was born. With my head again clear. I think of words to send to you. To coax you back to my side. But always leave out """"I love you"""". And then through my front door. A picture of a faraway land. And to with love on the back. And once again I reach for my pen."""

The wisdom of a life time always disappears untapped.. Paradise once given will always be taken back.. And the love you hang your life upon will start to slowly crack.. I have seen people suffocate the dream.. Forgetting to turn that one last time while she watches through the door.. Focusing on the garbage that she use to ignore.. Thinking she looks so beautiful but not yelling it out loud.. He should have thought to kiss her before he headed out.. Just forgetting how fucking lucky you are to have found her in such a crowd.. But we've seen a cloud of starlings rising on a crisp autumn day.. We were handed the weight of a child sleeping and bore her away.. We've tasted the tears that fall when saying goodbye forever.. And we've seen the silver from a waxing moon wash upon the shore.. I have heard about the lives of small swift birds.. They dazzle with their colour and their deftness through the air.. Just a simple glimpse will keep you simply standing there.. Legendary journeys made on fragile hollow wings.. The night skies rich with whistling each and every spring.. And then there's the day we look for them and can't find them anywhere.. I've been told that it's just the way life goes.
2888,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,Someday soon. I'm going to find myself a saviour. Sit him on the naugahide. And make him tell me the answers. Someday soon. He'll look at me. With the word in his eyes. He'll notice the hero to come. Someday soon. Someday soon. I'm going to find myself a leader. Someone who can take me. By the hand towards safety. Someday soon. With only a wink. He'll tell me all i need know. His personal call will come. Someday soon. Find myself another heart to carry this weight. Find another part to take. Someday soon. I'm going to find myself a banner. March when they tell me to. Cheer when it matters. Someday soon. Let's take our place. At the back of the bus. Erase all the lies we've been told. Shoulder the load of those that are dear. And look to the days to come. Someday soon
2889,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,Someone. Out there. Kneeling.. No one. Out there. Listening.. But what I want to know. Before you save my soul. Is who gave this power to that fucker up there?. Someone. Out there. Crying.. Someone. Out there. Waiting.. But what I want to know. Before I let you go. Is who gave this power to that fucker up there?.
2890,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,Speaking confidentially. the fire that burnt inside of me. has turned to ash the tortured tree. that grows beside the anguished sea. Speaking confidentially. Speaking metaphorically. the earth I trust beneath my feet. is moving now ever so slightly. I shift my feet but feel no relief. Speaking metaphorically. Speaking hypothetically. if the air you breathed was so unique. would you use it up to idly speak. or horde it for a rainy week. Speaking hypothetically. Speaking kind of cryptically. the sea that raged beside the tree. burning bright for all to see. it just might mean the most to me. Speaking kind of cryptically.
2891,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,Now it all begins. Or continues to. Spiral down. Spiral down. I've laid it out on paper. Instructions of what to do. As my mind begins to waver. Losing contact with you. Now it all begins. Or continues to. Spiral down. Spiral down. Look upon the self. Look upon the other. We need a better understanding. Or we'll spiral down. Spiral down. Continue to spiral down. I'm no where near my peace. As you spiral down
2892,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,Another note afloat upon this paper sea. Explain to me. how this can be. Another face erased. from this tidal pool. Found one day. then swept away. I will carry you my love. If you can carry me. through this summer of our discontent. Another day away. from clutching hands. Explain to me. how this can be. I will carry you my love. If you can carry me. through this summer of our discontent. Another falling wave. upon this crumbling beach. How many more. until we meet?. I will carry you my love. If you can carry me. through this summer of our discontent.
2893,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,The screen door slams. Mary' dress waves. Like a vision she dances across the porch. As the radio plays. Roy Orbison singing for the lonely. Hey that's me and I want you only. Don't turn me home again. I just can't face myself alone again. Don't run back inside. Darling you know just what I'm here for. So you're scared and you're thinking. That maybe we ain't that young anymore. Show a little faith there's magic in the night. You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright. Oh and that's alright with me. You can hide 'neath your covers. And study your pain. Make crosses from your lovers. Throw roses in the rain. Waste your summer praying in vain. For a saviour to rise from these streets. Well now I'm no hero. That's understood. All the redemption I can offer girl. Is beneath this dirty hood. With a chance to make it good somehow. Hey what else can we do now ?. Except roll down the window. And let the wind blow. Back your hair. Well the night's busting open. These two lanes will take us anywhere. We got one last chance to make it real. To trade in these wings on some wheels. Climb in back. Heaven's waiting on down the tracks. Oh-oh come take my hand. We're riding out tonight to case the promised land. Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road. Lying out there like a killer in the sun. Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run. Oh Thunder Road sit tight take hold. Thunder Road. Well I got this guitar. And I learned how to make it talk. And my car's out back. If you're ready to take that long walk. From your front porch to my front seat. The door's open but the ride it ain't free. And I know you're lonely. For words that I ain't spoken. But tonight we'll be free. All the promises'll be broken. There were ghosts in the eyes. Of all the boys you sent away. They haunt this dusty beach road. In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets. They scream your name at night in the street. Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet. And in the lonely cool before dawn. You hear their engines roaring on. But when you get to the porch they're gone. On the wind so Mary climb in. It's town full of losers. And I'm pulling out of here to win
2894,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,To lay me down. once more. To lay me down. With my head in sparkling clover. Let the world go by. All lost in dreaming. To lay me down. one last time. To lay me down. To be with you. once more. To be with you. with our bodies close together. Let the world go by. Like clouds a-streaming. To lay me down. once more. To lay me down. To lay me down. To lay me down. To lay me down. once more. To lay me down. To lie with you. one more. To lie with you. with our dreams entwined together. To lie beside you. my love still sleeping. to tell sweet lies. one last time. and say good-night. To lay me down. To lay me down. To lay me down. one last ime. To lay me down. To lay me down. one last ime. To lay me down.
2895,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,I buried him down by the river. 'cause that's where he liked to be. and every night when the moon is high. I go there and weep openly. He and I were married. By this river 'neath this willow tree. and with God and friends witnessing it. He pledged his life to me. To me he was Earth. and I rooted in his soil. I to he was Sky vast and free. of the burdens from which he toiled. Then one night a terrible fight. Words spoken better left unsaid. With his wedding vows ringing in my ears. He gave his life to me. They say to love is to bury. Those demons from which we all hide. But tonight by this river 'neath this willow tree. Becoming one of Earth and Sky.
2896,Cowboy Junkies,Rock,How could he take you in his arms. And help you to be free. Then leave you forgotten. And is it enough to cry. When you're so broken. Her cold eyes tell you that you're not welcome. She tells lies but you'll take her back again. And is it enough to die. When you're so taken. You will be loved again. You will be loved again. But will she sing and will she dance. And will she forever. But will he sing and wil he dance. And will he forever. Someday you will feel a love so deep. And you will find someone not lost in sleep. And you will be loved again. You will be loved again. You will be loved again.
2897,Creed,Rock,Hello my friend we meet again. It's been a while where should we begin. Feels like forever. Within my heart are memories. A perfect love that you gave to me. Oh I remember.

2898,Creed,Rock,At times life is wicked and I just can't. see the light. A silver lining sometimes isn't enough. To make some wrongs seem right. Whatever life brings. I've been through everything. And now I'm on my knees again. But I know I must go on. Although I hurt I must be strong. Because inside I know that many. feel this way. Children don't stop dancing. Believe you can fly. Away...away. At times life's unfair and you know. it's plain to see. Hey God I know I'm just a dot in. this world. Have you forgot about me?. Whatever life brings. I've been through everything.

2899,Creed,Rock,I can't find the rhyme in all my reason. Lost sense of time and all seasons. Feel I've been beaten down. By the words of men who have no grounds. Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom. When your ax has cut the roots that feed them. Forked tongues in bitter mouths. Can drive a man to bleed from inside out. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine. Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind. Human pride sings a vengeful song. Inspired by the times you've been walked on. My stage is shared by many millions. Who lift their hands up high because they feel this. We are one We are strong. The more you hold us down the more we press on. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. [Guitar Break]. I know I can't hold the hate inside my mind. 'Cause what consumes your thoughts. controls your life. So I'll just ask a question. An only simple question. I'll just ask one question. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. What if your words could be judged like a crime?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?
2900,Creed,Rock,I can't explain. Can't quite put my finger on. The difference that makes us so different. We've said everything... our words only betray us. Nothing is left... nothing was left unsaid. This time... I have nothing left to lose. I'm stuck... the second hand won't move. It's about time that I speak my mind. It's about time... about time I find. Pieces of me I have lost. Without any choice I move on. Hey time you're no friend of mine. Hey time you're no friend of mine. You cover yourself... you cover your skin. You cover yourself... like you cover your sin. Please untie my hands... I'm a sinner... I'm a man. I ask for one minute... to make you understand.

Till you lost your desire. And I melted to learn. I thought I could keep you from changing shape. But two people cannot believe. On one man's faith. And your love it was an hourglass. What I thought I'd found. Was too good to last. And your love it was a promise made. But our lock and key. Held a broken chain. And now when I see you. I don't understand. And all I needed from you then. Has now become all the time on my hands. It was torture to see it comin'. As we reached the end of days. The sands of time were fallin'. From a premature heart decay. And as I stood in falsehood. In our final hour. I prayed for the roots of a redwood. But you withered like a flower. And when you finally spoke. The words that broke my heart. I couldn't blame you too much. Cause I knew from the start. And your love it was an hourglass. What I thought I'd found. Was too good to last. And your love it was a promise made. But our lock and key. Held a broken chain. And now when I see you. I don't understand. And all I needed from you then. Has now become all the time on my hands. And your love it was an hourglass.

He stole her innocence. And this is how she carried on. This is how she carried on. Well I guess she closed her eyes. And just imagined everything's alright. But she could not hide her tears. 'Cause they were sent to wash away those years. They were sent to wash away those years. My anger's violent. But still I'm silent. When tragedy strikes at home. I know this decadence. Is shared by millions. Remember you're not alone. Remember you're not alone. Well if you'll just close your eyes. And just imagine everythings alright. But do not hide your tears.

2922,Creed,Rock,I can't find the rhyme in all my reason. Lost sense of time and all seasons. Feel I've been beaten down. By the words of men who have no grounds. Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom. When your ax has cut the roots that feed them. Forked tongues in bitter mouths. Can drive a man to bleed from inside out. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine. Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind. Human pride sings a vengeful song. Inspired by the times you've been walked on. My stage is shared by many millions. Who lift their hands up high because they feel this. We are one We are strong. The more you hold us down the more we press on. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. [Guitar Break]. I know I can't hold the hate inside my mind. 'Cause what consumes your thoughts. controls your life. So I'll just ask a question. An only simple question. I'll just ask one question. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. What if your words could be judged like a crime?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?
2923,Creed,Rock,Run hide. All that was sacred to us. Sacred to us. See the signs. The covenant has been broken. By mankind. Leaving us with no shoulder...with no shoulder. To rest our head on. To rest our head on. To rest our head on. Who's got my back now?. When all we have left is deceptive. So disconnected. So what is the truth now?. There's still time. All that has been devastated. Can be recreated. Realize. We pick up the broken pieces. Of our lives. Giving ourselves to each other..ourselves to each other. To rest our head on. To rest our head on. To rest our head on. Who's got my back now?. When all we have left is deceptive. So disconnected. So what is the truth now?. What is the truth now?. Tell me the truth now?. Who's got my back now?. When all we have left is deceptive. So disconnected. So what is the truth now?
2924,Cruithne Band,Rock,Eu me lembrei que te vi nos braços meus. Pois eu fiquei te guardando em mim. Mas não há como esquecer a dor. Uma manhã de chuva na sua direção.

And the changes are good. Sometimes we don't realize. I could not hide. I needed to say. Maybe I want you. But what I feel inside. I don't wanna hurt me. But I have to try. I would try to make the best I could. You are a not a problem. you are better than you think. You are better than me

2941,Dead Fish,Rock,Dead Fish - Diariamente. Mais uma pessoa jogada nas ruas. e você nem percebeu. Mais uma prova da sua miséria. que você finge não perceber. O que ha de errado em sua vida. o que foi que aconteceu. você não pode dizer que apenas se acostumou. Tragédias diárias vividas nas ruas do Brasil. Você fingiu que não viu e também que não ouviu. Erros da vida lapsos de percepção. Diariamente e você sequer estende a mão. Mais um pretinho jogado nas ruas. e você se enfureceu. Por onde é que você esteve por todos esses anos. por onde é que você andou. Esperando sentado que um dia tudo vá melhorar. Tragédias diárias vividas nas ruas de um país. Nem olhar pro lado e fingir que é feliz. E nem a violência vivida diariamente faz você mudar. eh melhor ficar sentado e esperar até morrer. E sobre a miséria e a televisão. e sobre o governo e o cidadão. e sobre nossas vidas meu irmão. e sobre o Estado e a constituição. e sobre tudo. diariamenteee. diariamente... diariamenteeeeee
2942,Dead Fish,Rock,Caminhando pra pagar por um pouco de paz. Andando a toa por aí. Buscando algo na paisagem. (Quem pode ver?). Tanques cheios vão mais longe onde querem chegar. Não importa o preço. Vidas dissolvidas em carbono. (Pra queimar!). É preciso ser um pouco mais veloz. Tento escapar dessa prisão. Rumo ao paraíso sem olhar pra trás. Na bagagem novos truques pra quem nunca viu. Armas de sobrevivência tão comuns de onde vim. (O cinza e o caos!!!). É preciso ser um pouco mais veloz. Tento escapar dessa prisão. Rumo ao paraíso sem olhar pra trás. Trago em meu bolso a discórdia. Trago em meu sangue a destruição. Construindo quase o mesmo. Contrariando meus desejos. Dessa forma trago o melhor. O progresso sempre foi a solução. Tento escapar dessa prisão. Rumo ao paraíso sem olhar pra trás. Trago em meu bolso a discórdia. Trago em meu sangue a destruição

Nous sommes les paraibes. Post apres proto. Nous sommes les paraibes. Nous sommes les paraibes!. La revolution. Sem futuro os que servem. O chão do mundo os que não esperam.

Nós somos o futuro não escrito. Nós somos os paraíbas. Nós somos o que não se previu. Será televisionado o rebote das massas. As balas verdadeiras a reação a baderna. Verá! uma montanha de corpos.

2946,Dead Fish,Rock,Vejo em seus olhos a derrota. O que será de mim a partir daqui?. Te vendo de joelhos a se humilhar. A missão está cumprida antes que esperava. Não devia ter me empenhando tanto. E você podia ter resistido mais. Quando seus olhos baixaram. Perdi toda motivação. Agora me encontro aqui parado. Sentado esperando outro de você. Pra dar algum sentido em minha vida. Viver essa vingança é o que me mantem. Não devia ter me empenhando tanto. E você podia ter resistido mais. Quando seus olhos baixaram. Perdi toda motivação
2947,Dead Fish,Rock,Disse o que sabiam. Mas nunca ousou. Disse o que sempre desejou. Não se acovardou em momentos sociais. Tão difíceis de aceitar. E falar demais. Por não ter o que dizer. Poucas coisas em que segurar. De costas não se importar. O desconforto que os faz tão mal. Não há prestígio. Que passe do chão. Prazer em ser. Diferente de você. Abalando o que é claro. Pôr em duvida o que você diz ser certo. Bater de frente e não titubear. Tudo que em choque faz mover o ar. Desprezar mais um sinal. Desafiar toda a moral. De outra forma dança multidão. No ritmo que os fez morrer. Aprendendo a sonhar igual. Esqueceram de viver. Custou caro ser assim. Fiel companhia a solidão. E toda a dor valerá. Pois não existe o fim. O que é o fim pra mim?. Poucas coisas em que segurar. De costas não se importar. O desconforto que os faz tão mal. Não há prestígio. Que passe do chão. Prazer em ser. Diferente de você
2948,Dead Fish,Rock,Não há nada em que tropeçar. A duras penas se erguer. Prontos pra um novo começo. Re-aprender a andar. Sentir perder. Reconstruir. E caminhar pro que virá. Nos desejo força. Já que o pior já passou. Ter coragem para dar as mãos. Sentir viver e destruir. E aceitar que nos fazia mal. E implodiram tudo que os oprimia. Precisavam refazer os seus conceitos. Sentir vencer. Reconstruir. E caminhar pro que virá. Apesar de quase duvidar. Apesar de quase não aceitar
2949,Dead Fish,Rock,O vento mudou. Não sopra a favor. No canto dos olhos. A conspiração. É quase a hora. Sem ter o lugar. Pois servos precisam de queda e ascensão. Um novo herói irá surgir. E se convencer. Que será eterno. Quando a chuva cair. Sonhos sinceros de poder. Pra corromper. Bodes expiatórios de um jogo sem fim. Quando a chuva cair. E varrer as certezas. (Quando a chuva cair!). De suas frágeis raízes. Quando a chuva cair
2950,Dead Fish,Rock,Como você aprendeu. a viver assim?. Você nunca vai conseguir parar!. Nem perceber!. Condenado a nunca olhar pro lado. Você deseja somente o que te mandam. Confortável conceder. O que é você?. O que você quer?. Desejos Colonizados!. Tente se livrar!. Coisas tão vazias para mim. Parecem ser tão cheias pra você. Quem te colonizou?. Quem você vai culpar?. Tente agora encontrar o que finge ser. Como você gostaria de me castigar?. Me aponte a direção. Você sabe que pode ser muito melhor. Apenas não quer ver. O que é você?. O que você quer?. Seus sonhos colonizados. Vão te devorar!
2951,Dead Fish,Rock,The ugly face of pain has stucked me again. I find myself bleeding. I found myself crying. My slashed soul drop tears. It all fuck of fear. Won't is my believe destroying beliefs. Sorrow loneliness oppression. Why that's the question. I just wanna be free. And give the old bad things. That keeping happening to me. Until my dreams come true. Will turn me to another nightmare. And nobody really cares. I feel the ugly face of pain. But after there's no gain. Just another tortuous day. I wish I couldn't have another way. My face is ugly and sad. My body is weak and dead. Every time hard find back. When I think on my past. I have all my own living in hell. Inside of my heart are the devils. Look at myself and see a sick old tree
2952,Dead Fish,Rock,Don't you know that you are a man. And a man never become afraid. Because you are strong and have some muscles. You don't need to listen knowledge. And you don't care about anything. And all your fucking life is having fun. Might!. You'll die you are fucked. Don't you know what I mean. You are a mindless beast. Reading fashion magazines. Right!. You might you got no feelings. You think in your own self. All the weeks and all days. And the earth is only your country. And your flag is full of pride. And the land that you are living with a lie. Some day you'll find out. That all has gone wrong. And the bullshit that you're. Living is gone away. Five different races. Around the world. All of them are full of pain. And guy like this. Care with the apparence. Imposed by society

I don't want to get old no. Dream. A little dream. About your friends. And their endings. Now I wanna wake up. I wanna wake up now. It could be the death of me. Knowing that my friends.

2960,Deerhunter,Rock,When you were young. And your excitement showed. But as time goes by. Does it outgrow. Is that the way things go. Forever reaching for the goal. Forever fading black. Comes a glow. Walking free. Come with me. Far away. Every day. When you were young. You never knew which way to go. What was once gray. No undertones. Well every day do what you can. If you let them turn you round. Whatever goes up. Must come down. Walking free. Come with me. Far away. Every day
2961,Deerhunter,Rock,I got a message. Pretend you'll guess what it said. Drive alone. Drive straight home. I did as instructed. Closed my door and locked it. Disappearing ink. but the words still sting. I sat and wrote a letter. I described the weather. and the scene. Remembering.... I forget tomorrow. For all the sickness and sorrow. Disappearing ink. but the words still sting. What was I thinking?. What was I thinking?
2962,Deerhunter,Rock,Do you recall waking up on a dirty couch in the gray fog?. And the gray dog barking down the street?. Columns shake your feet. Beneath your feet. Beneath your feet. Beneath your feet. Do you recall - your face was white as all?. Do you bone the sheets?. Do you think of me?. Your long lost friend from the sea. How long was heat?. How long was he?. How long was he?. How long was he?. How long was heat?. How long was he?
2963,Deerhunter,Rock,Ollie off the sidewalk. Watch your brother bleeding. Take him by the hand and. Lead him to the slipstream. Famous last words. Famous last words. Famous last words. Famous last words. Bring you(?) in the vortex. Watch your skin erupting. Nothing can be said now. Nothing can be changed. Famous last words. Famous last words. Famous last words. Famous last words
2964,Deerhunter,Rock,I forgot my book. At the fountain stairs. At a chapter on symmetry. Nobody cares. And I had a smoke. While I traced the squares. Put my finger to concrete. Felt the autumn air. When I look around. I can feel it spinning. Feet on the ground. Head on the ceiling. Sun on my shirt. Sweat on my hands. All falling in retrograde. Cancel all my plans. And I had to look. At the marching band. Skip across the pavement. Nobody's there. When I look around. I can feel it spinning. Feet on the ground. Head on the ceiling

If you can send me an angel. If you can't send me an angel. Send me something else instead. Send my heart to the sea. Oh the empty sea. But there's a light in the core. And there's nothing left no more. No more no. If you can't choose me. Then you can't see. There's a light in my heart. And it' won't be there tomorrow. There's a man. There is a mystery whore. And in my dying days. I could never be sure. Well never mind. And then they take me away. And then they take you away. They'll never take me away. And in my head. There is something rotting dead. I can't compete with her. Let me be released from this. Mono-monomania
2968,Deerhunter,Rock,Finding the fluorescence in the junk. By night illuminates the day. Finding ancient language in the blood. Fading a little more each day. And if you've got a lot of pain. You remember how to speak. And if you gather all the rain. Yeah it's still coming down in sheets. Neon rust puts color in the blood. Call upon the words to speak. Everything is the same as it was. But now there's nothing left to change. And if you got a ritual. We've drowned by rain. And if you memorize the words. They will show you the way
2969,Deerhunter,Rock,No one's sleeping. Great unrest. In the country. There's much duress. Violence has taken hold. Follow me. The golden void. No one's sleeping. The village green. Is nocturnal. Finally. Follow me. To golden pond. There is peace. The great beyond

2975,Dire Straits,Rock,These mist covered mountains. Are a home now for me. But my home is the lowlands. And always will be. Some day you'll return to. Your valleys and your farms. And you'll no longer burn. To be brothers in arms. Through these fields of destruction. Baptism of fire. I've witnessed your suffering. As the battles raged higher. And though they did hurt me so bad. In the fear and alarm. You did not desert me. My brothers in arms. There's so many different worlds. So many different suns. And we have just one world. But we live in different ones. Now the sun's gone to hell. And the moon's riding high. Let me bid you farewell. Every man has to die. But it's written in the starlight. And every line on your palm. We're fools to make war. On our brothers in arms
2976,Dire Straits,Rock,You walk out on the high wire. You're a dancer on thin ice. You pay no heed to the danger. And less to advice. Your footsteps are forbidden. But with knowledge of your sin. You throw your love to all the strangers. And caution to the wind. And you go dancing through doorways. Just to see what you will find. Leaving nothing to interfere. With the crazy balance of your mind. And when you finally reappear. At the place where you came in. You've thrown your love to all the strangers. And caution to the wind. It takes lover over gold. And mind over matter. To do what you do that you must. When the things that you hold. Can fall and be shattered. Or run through your fingers like dust.
2977,Dire Straits,Rock,It's a mystery to me ... the game commences. for the usual fee ... plus expenses. confidential information ... it's in a diary. This is my investigation ... it's not a public inquary. I go checking out the reports ... digging up the dirt. you get to meet all sorts in this line of work. treachery and treason ... there's always an excuse for it. and when I find the reason I still can't get used to it. And what have you got at the end of the day?. what have you got to take away?. a bottle of whisky and a new set of lies. blinds on the windows and a pain behind the eyes. Scarred for life ... nocompensation. private investigations.

2979,Dire Straits,Rock,"""Sweet surrender on the quayside. You remember we used to run and hide. In the shadow of the cargoes I take you one time. And we're counting all the numbers down to the waterline. Near misses on the dogleap stairways. French kisses in the darkened doorways. A foghorn blowing out wild and cold. A policeman shines a light upon my shoulder. Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the night. Over my shoulder all you can see are the pilot lights. No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn. Your hands are cold but your lips are warm. She can see him on the jetty where they used to go. She can feel him in the places where the sailors go. When she's walking by the river and the railway line. She can still hear him whisper. """"Let's go down to the waterline"""""""
2980,Dire Straits,Rock,Calling Elvis - is anybody home. Calling Elvis - I'm here all alone. Did he leave the building. Or can he come to the phone. Calling Elvis - I'm here all alone.

2981,Dire Straits,Rock,I'm just an ageing drummer boy. And in the wars I used to play. And I've called the tune. To many a torture session. Now they say I am a war criminal. And I'm fading away. Father please hear my confession. I have legalised robbery. Called it belief. I have run with the money. And hid like a thief. I have re-written history. With my armies and my crooks. Invented memories. I did burn all the books. And I can still hear his laughter. And I can still hear his song. The man's too big. The man's too strong. Well I have tried to be meek. And I have tried to be mild. But I spat like a woman. And sulked like a child. I have lived behind walls. They have made me alone. Striven for peace. Which I never have known. And I can still hear his laughter. And I can still hear his song. The man's too big. The man's too strong. Well the sun rose on the courtyard. And they all did hear him say. ' You always were a Judas. But I got you anyway. You may have got your silver. But I swear upon my life. Your sister gave me diamonds. And I gave them to your wife '. Oh Father please help me. For I have done wrong. The man's too big. The man's too strong.

2987,Dire Straits,Rock,I wonder where you are tonight. You're probably on the rampage somewhere. You have been known to take delight. In gettin' in somebody's hair. And you always had the knack. Fade to black. I bet you already made a pass. I see a darkened room somewhere. You run your finger round the rim of his glass. Run your fingers through his hair. They scratch across his back. Fade to black. Well maybe it's all for the best. But I wish I'd never been lassoed. Maybe it's some kind of test. I wish I'd never been tattooed. Or been to hell and back. Fade to black
2988,Dire Straits,Rock,The sky is crying the streets are full of tears. Rain come down wash away my fears. And all this writing on the wall. Oh I can read between the lines. Rain come down forgive this dirty town. Rain come down and give this dirty town. A drink of water a drink of wine. If I been hard on you I never chose to be. I never wanted no one else. I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to. Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to. As you'd sleep I'd think my heart would break in two. I'd kiss your cheek I'd stop myself from waking you. But in the dark you'd speak my name. You'd say baby what's wrong ?. Oh ? Here I am baby I'm coming back for more. I'm like a wave that's got to roll into the shore. Yes and if my love's in vain how come my love is so strong ?. Now you and me go parallel together and apart. And you keep your perfect distance and it's tearing at my heart. Did you never feel the distance. You never tried to cross no line. Now it's another dirty river and another dirty scar. And I don't know who's kissing you and I don't know where you are. So far from home don't you thing of me sometime. Sky is crying see the streets are full of tears. Rain coming down to wash away my fears. And all this writing on the wall. Oh I can read between the lines.
2989,Dire Straits,Rock,Harry made a bareback rider proud and free upon a horse. And a fine coalminer for the NCB that was. A fallen angel and Jesus on the cross. A skating ballerina you should have seen her do the skater's waltz. Some people have got to paint and draw. Harry had to work in clay and stone. Like the waves coming to the shore. It was in his blood and in his bones. Ignored by all the trendy boys in London and in Leeds. He might as well have been making toys or strings of beads. He could not be in the gallery. And then you get an artist says he doesn't want to paint at all. He takes an empty canvas and sticks it on the wall. The birds of a feather all the phonies and all of the fakes. While the dealers they get together. And they decide who gets the breaks. And who's going to be in the gallery. No lies he wouldn't compromise. No junk no bits of string. And all the lies we subsidise. That just don't mean a thing. I've got to say he passed away in obscurity. And now all the vultures are coming down from the tree. So he's going to be the gallery.
2990,Dire Straits,Rock,I hear the Seven Deadly Sins. And the Terrible Twins came to call on you. The bigger they are babe. The harder they fall on you. And you you're always the same you persevere. On the same old pleasure ground. Oh and it never rains around here. It just comes pouring down. You had no more volunteers. So you got profiteers for to help you out. With friends like that babe. Good friends you had to do without. And now they're taken the chains and the gears. From off your merry-go-round. Oh and it never rains around here. It just comes pouring down. And your new Romeo. Was just a gigolo when he let you down. See the faster they are babe. The faster they get out of town. Leaving make up stains and the tears. Of a clown. Yes and it never rains around here. It just comes pouring down. Oh you were just a roller coaster memory. I don't know why I was even passing through. I saw you making a date with Destiny. When he came around here asking after you. In the shadow of the Wheel Of Fortune. You're busy trying to clear your name. You say ' I may be guilty yeah that may be true. But I'd be lying if I said I was to blame. See we could have been major contenders. We never got no money no breaks '. You're got a list of all the major offenders. You got a list of all their major mistakes. And he's just standing in the shadows. Yes and you smile that come-on smile. Oh I can still hear you say as clear as the day. ' I'd like to make it worth your while '. Ah but it's sad reminder. When your organ grinder has to come to you for rent. And all you've got to give him. Is the use of your side-show tent. Yes and that's all that remains of the years. Spent doing the rounds. And I never never rains around here. Well it just comes pouring down. Now you know what they say about beggars. You can't complain about the rules. You know what they are about beggars. You know who's the first to blame his tools. You never gave a damn about who you pick up. And leave laying bleeding on the ground. You screw people over on the way up. Because you thought that you were never coming down. And he takes you out in Vaudeville Valley. With his hand up smothering your screams. And he screws you down in Tin Pan Alley. In the city of a billion dreams
2991,Dire Straits,Rock,Les boys do cabaret. Les boys are glad to be gay. They're not afraid now. Disco bar in germany. Les boys are glad to be. Upon parade now. Les boys got leather straps. Les boys got ss caps. But they got no gun now. Get dressed up get a little risque. Got to do a little s & m these days. It's all in fun now. Les boys come on again. For the high class whores. And the businessmen. Who drive in their mercedes benz. To a disco bar in old munchen. They get the jokes that the d.j. makes. They get nervous and they make mistakes. They're bad for business. Some tourist take a photograph. Les boys don't get one laugh. He says they're useless. Late at night when they're gone away. Les boys dream of jean genet. High heel shoes and a black beret. And the posters on the wall that say. Les boys do cabaret. Les boys are glad to be gay.
2992,Dire Straits,Rock,Red sun go down way over dirty town. Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals. A girl is there high heeling across the square. Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles. Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light. She looks around to find a face she can like. Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong. Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays. They're all in the station praying for trains. Congregation late again. It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days. Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright. He's crazy lion howling for a fight. Strap hanging gunshot sound. Doors slamming on the overground. Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone. Her evening paper is horror torn. But there's hope later for Capricorns. Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home. Then she's reading about a swing to the right. But she's thinking about a stranger in the night. I'm thinking about the lions tonight. What happened to the lions.
2993,Dire Straits,Rock,You walk out on the high wire. You're a dancer on thin ice. You pay no heed to the danger. And less to advice. Your footsteps are forbidden. But with knowledge of your sin. You throw your love to all the strangers. And caution to the wind. And you go dancing through doorways. Just to see what you will find. Leaving nothing to interfere. With the crazy balance of your mind. And when you finally reappear. At the place where you came in. You've thrown your love to all the strangers. And caution to the wind. It takes lover over gold. And mind over matter. To do what you do that you must. When the things that you hold. Can fall and be shattered. Or run through your fingers like dust.

2995,Dire Straits,Rock,Can\'t find no sleeves for my records. Can\'t get no laces for for my shoes. Can\'t get no fancy notes. On my blue guitar. Can\'t get no antidote for blues. Can\'t find the reasons for your actions. Or I don\'t much like the reasoning you use. Somehow your motives are impure. Or somehow I can\'t find the cure. Can\'t find no antidote for blues. They say it\'s mostly vanity. That writes the plays we act. They tell me that\'s what everybody knows. There\'s no such thing as sanity. And that\'s the sanest fact. That\'s the way the story goes. Can\'t get remedy on my TV. There\'s nothing but the same old news. They can\'t find a way to be. One world in harmony. Can\'t get no antidote for blues
2996,Dire Straits,Rock,Planet of New Orleans. Standin' on the corner. Of Toulouse and Dauphine. Waitin' on Marie-Ondine. I'm tryin' to place a tune. Under a Louisiana moonbeam. On the planet of New Orleans. In a bar they call The Saturn. And in her eyes of green. And somethin' that she said in a dream. Inside of my suit I got my mojo root. And a true love figurine. For the planet of New Orleans. New Orleans - the other planet. With other life upon it. And everythin' that's shakin' in between. If you should ever land upon it. You better know what's on it. The planet of New Orleans. Now I'm tryin' to find my way. Through the rain and the steam. I'm lookin' straight ahead through the screen. And then I heard her say. Somethin' in the Limousine. 'Bout takin' a ride across the planet of New Orleans. If she was an ace. And I was just a jack. And the cards were never seen. We could have been the king and queen. But she took me back to her courtyard. Where magnolia perfume screams. Behind the gates and the granite. Of the planet of New Orleans

Mind-free from delusion and fear. Consciousness of eternity. Om. I'm traveling through the cosmic sea. away from here. Astral power makes me fly. Eternal present shows the way. Every memory is gone. Away from here. I found the key to the door of my being. The silence fills me. I'm traveling through cosmic sea. away from here. Curtains of lights and shadows disappeared. Every sadness is dispelled. Lights of hidden joy died. Hazy carnal landscapes ended. You are me and I am you. Quiet unbroken shiver. Eternally alive eternally new peace. outside the limit of lethal form. Om. Mind-free from delusion and fear. Consciousness of eternity. Om. I'm traveling through the cosmic sea. away from here

3023,Duran Duran,Pop,How does it feel. When everyone surrounds you?. How do you deal. Do crowds just make you feel lonely?. What do you say?. When people come and try to pin you down?. Aquaintainces smile. But that's no understanding. How after a while. You keep falling off the same mountain. Try to explain it. But nothing really gets them that high. Steal away in the morning. Love's already history to you. It's a habit you're forming. This body's desperate for something new. Just a matter of feeling. This moment's madness is sure to pass. And tears will dry as you're leaving. Who knows you might find something to last. Emotion's a game. Saved up for a rainy Monday. But you laught just the same. 'Cause it's been pouring on Sunday. Call up your numbers. And never let the zeros bring you down. How does it feel?. Is time too heavy to hold?. Whatever you decide. For the moment is holy. Whenever you slow down. To see life is passing by. Steal away in the morning. Love's alredy history to you. It's a habit you're forming. This body's desperate for something new. Just a matter of feeling.

Dance in the the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams. Dance in to the fire that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire. Choice for you is the view to a kill.

Outside is there anyone out there anyone else outside. O-utside love is there anyone out there anyone else outside. My face in the mirror shows a break in time. A crack in the ocean which does not align. I tried to sleep last night but I've caught you dreaming. About days we used to wonder away. Outside is there anyone out there anyone else outside. O-utside love is there anyone out there anyone else outside. Look out of the window maybe you can call by my name. Another night over babe another light coves on in vain. Oh I tried to phone last night but you never answered. Just left me ringing in the air. Is there anyone out there. Anyone out there
3028,Duran Duran,Pop,To the voyeur. Sitting in a darkened room. Do you thrill. When the green light starts pulsing. Paranoia. The only valid point of view. If you know. What I'm saying. I'm not alone. Being followed. Someone always watching what we do. Never alone. But I'm in the shadows. I dream things I don't want you to know. Something shifting. Between the sirens and the glow. Of red lights. And the blue slowly turning. The fog is lifting. A silhouette begins to show. And the moment is stolen. I'm not alone. Being followed. Someone always watching what we do. Never alone. But I'm in the shadows. I dream things I don't want you to know. In this chamber. Lit by scandal. You're the bullet. In the barrel. You're the last thing. As I'm falling. Bloody roaring. Still I'm calling out. I'm calling out. I'm not alone. Being followed. Never alone. I'm being followed. I'm not alone. Being followed. Never alone. I'm being followed. La la la la la la la

3030,Duran Duran,Pop,By the look on your face. You've been awake all night. It started raining in the early light. You're fooling the mirror. But you don't fool me. A drift in your own sympathy.

You can make it through tomorrow. Set free your butterfly girl. And when you rise above the sorrow. You be a butterfly girl. Now you're drunk in the dream of your life as dirt.

3034,Duran Duran,Pop,Now an unexpected peace comes to the day. As the howling dimmed the fighting dies away. When the hanging dust is clearing from the air. You can just make out a lonely figure there. He's the last man standing on the track. He does not look down. He does not look back. He's the last man standing on the track. You can't hold him down. You can't hold him back. He's the last man standing on the track. He does not look down. He does not look back. He's the last man standing on the track. You can't hold him down. You can't hold him back. He's sorry for the wrong he has done. And he cries out for the anger for so long. All the cuts and bruises suffered. In whose name. Oh but now is not the time to face his shame. He's the last man standing on the track. He does not look down. He does not look back. He's the last man standing on the track. You can't hold him down. You can't hold him back. The last man standing on the track. He does not look down. He does not look back. He's the last man standing on the track. You can't hold him down. You can't hold him back.

3036,Duran Duran,Pop,Shake up the picture. The lizard mixture. With your dance on the eventide. You got me coming up with answers. All of which I deny. I said it again. Could I please rephrase it?. Maybe I can catch a ride. I couldn't really put it much plainer. But I'll wait till you decide. Send me your warning siren. As if I could ever hide. Last time la luna. I light my torch. And wave it for the new moon on Monday. And a fire dance. Through the night. I stayed the cold day. With a lonely satellite. Breaking away. With the beast of both worlds. A smile that you can't disguise. Every minute I keep finding. Clues that you leave behind. Send me from these reminders. As if I'd forget tonight. This time la luna
3037,Duran Duran,Pop,Dark sun rose on the ridge cut clear across the sky. As good a day as any to die. No reservation madam. No reason to know why. Running late stiletto heels. Try to loosen up the wheels. You spend your life in preparation for this day. Breathe in the air; it's loaded with fame. Check out those weapons sister before you hit the fray. String of pearls meet bits of gems. Enter the battle of the lenses. Red carpet massacre. Don't want to hassle you. Red carpet massacre. Deathstalk papparazzi yeah. Red carpet massacre. It's going to mess with you. We're in business. You're on the hit list. There's not so many now still standing on their feet. Their knives are out and singing so sweet. Engage with sharper minds that cut you when you meet. Anyplace to mess around. When someone wants to take you down. Maybe you think you're above this. But baby we know that you love it. Baby you know where to shove it. Apply your lipstick. 'Fore dying in public. Red carpet massacre. Don't want to hassle you. Red carpet massacre. Deathstalk papparazzi yeah. Red carpet massacre. Don't want to mess with you. Now it's time. Next in line. We're so busted. Done and dusted
3038,Duran Duran,Pop,5. shotgun. Get it together. Thing is jumpin'. I wanna see your. Bullets pumpin'. Shotgun. Itchy finger. On the trigger. Got to make the. Shooter bigger. Shotgun.
3039,Duran Duran,Pop,You shine. Where others fade. You dare to be so brave. Don't compromise. No one can hurt you. Just believe. Just believe. Come to heaven. Silva halo. Come to heaven. Silva halo. Silva halo...
3040,Duran Duran,Pop,Those tears on a gaping voice. Who's stretching arms match the hunger of mine. There lips will they never join. But always draw me closer and further entwined. With a promise dealer understand all freedoms fade away. To a point of view where many different pathways meet. And we're standing on this precipice with nothing much to save. But the deep blue screams of falling dreams with our next move. Heaven hide your eyes (heaven hide your eyes). Heaven's eyes will never dry (heaven's eyes will never dry). . The shades of a thousand steel. Come flashing by my face in the fury of war. In desolation and abandoned fields. The hungry make their stand when they'll stand for no more. Hear the passion in their voices see the heaven in their eyes. Their hopes and schemes are waiting dreams of less than paradise. And sometimes we make promises we never mean to keep. For blackmail is the only deal a promise dealer sees. . (chorus) (chorus). (chorus) (chorus) (chorus).
3041,Duran Duran,Pop,These are days of hit and run. In the stream with everyone. Is a moment of our lives. On a wandering river. Going on together. Many journeys to arrive. I've been walking. Through the valley. Through the tall grass. And the shadows. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. Through the city. And the towers. Turning minutes. Into hours. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. When I think I'm being strong. And I lose direction. then a life starts looking mischievous. Finding revelation. Out of desperation. Always stretching time. But it's never long enough. You think you're happy. Think you're free. But maybe we're just. Comfortably dizzy. I've been running. Through the valley. Through the tall grass. And the shadows. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. Through the city. And the towers. Turning minutes. Into hours. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. I've been running. Through the valley. Through the tall grass. Through the shadows. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. Through the city. And the towers. Turning minutes. Into hours. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it
3042,Duran Duran,Pop,When your nine day feed is up. And you've drained your loving cup. Come stands reeling to the shore. When the brave are coming out. The dry fight and the dusty shout. See you crawling on the floor. And diamond stars shine glitter bright. Gorging your sanhedralite. Words are falling to the floor. Glands stand pouring fruit tree. Now they glisten on the waterline. See how you are at the shore. I'm moving chrissie pretty flowers in the shutter maze. Haul up all your petty desires. Leave it lying down before. Wash away the rusty disease. Of your brown town days in our silver sea. Leave it dying at the door. Feather yell you've time to leave. Open out your arms and breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
3043,Duran Duran,Pop,[instrumental]
3044,Duran Duran,Pop,We are undergoing treatment. Watching others in the news. Studying our worst reviews. They say we'll get over it. Disappear like dinosaurs. To the sound of sole applause. Designed to make us special. If you see me walking in the garden. Don't ever ask me for an autograph. If you ever catch me in the arcade. Don't even stop me for a photograph. We are undergoing treatment. Till our ethic fits the scene. Layed out in Q Magazine. They crave our conformity. Mediocre to the bone. Terrified testosterone. But why do we still face the music. If you see me walking in the garden. Don't ever ask me... Now and then you get the strangest notion. That there's something missing. But it keeps you guessing. Wild ambition can you really blame us?. Can you entertain us?. Can you give a little more?. (chorus). We are undergoing treatment. Will the doctors ever cure. These delusions of grandeur?.
3045,Duran Duran,Pop,I'm giving you the news. Your domination's through. You gave the best you've got. Now I'm out on top. If you're in any doubt. Listen to me. I've got a right to say. If you know what it's all about. Who do you think you are?. . Don't wanna be your enemy. If I'm not the one you want me to be. And I've gotta do things the way that I do. Always trying to control. Who do you think you are?. . Our time on earth is running through. (It's not a question of my pride). Sometimes I think it's a game to you. (You wonder how to feel inside). Sometimes I play along. But man I've got a mind!. You've gotta live with yourself. For the rest of you life. Do you understand?. Everybody asks the same question. Who do you think you are?. Why do feel ashamed. When you can't explain the things I say. To other people. This just occurred to me. A possibility. The thought that you might really want to be me.
3046,Duran Duran,Pop,Zooming in. Stood on the line. You understand. I've been waiting forever. Come rain come shine. In the wind in the snow. In the filty weather. You've got it all worked out. Ya but it knocks you out. But I'm zooming in. Now she arrives. In a flaming crash. Like a falling star. Heading straight for the dive. Gonna make some cash. With the avatar. You got it all worked out. I know you know. I don't want you to go. Ya but it knocks you out. I'm zooming in on you on you. Don't look back you�re a heart attack x 4. You've got it all worked out. Ya but it knocks you out. We're not alone. In the 2nd life. There are millions like us. Right here. In the stones. In the air too bright. All the new insiders. You've got it all worked out. I know you know. I don't want you to go. Ya but it knocks you out. I'm zooming in on you on you. Na na na na na na. I know you know. I don't want you to go. Na na na na na na. I'm zooming in and out on you
3047,Duran Duran,Rock,How does it feel. When everyone surrounds you?. How do you deal. Do crowds just make you feel lonely?. What do you say?. When people come and try to pin you down?. Aquaintainces smile. But that's no understanding. How after a while. You keep falling off the same mountain. Try to explain it. But nothing really gets them that high. Steal away in the morning. Love's already history to you. It's a habit you're forming. This body's desperate for something new. Just a matter of feeling. This moment's madness is sure to pass. And tears will dry as you're leaving. Who knows you might find something to last. Emotion's a game. Saved up for a rainy Monday. But you laught just the same. 'Cause it's been pouring on Sunday. Call up your numbers. And never let the zeros bring you down. How does it feel?. Is time too heavy to hold?. Whatever you decide. For the moment is holy. Whenever you slow down. To see life is passing by. Steal away in the morning. Love's alredy history to you. It's a habit you're forming. This body's desperate for something new. Just a matter of feeling. This moment's madness is sure to past. And tears will dry as your're leaving. Who knows you might find something to last. You can steal away in the morning. Love's already history to you. It's a habit you're forming. This body's desperate for something new. Just a matter of feeling. This moment's madness is sure to pass. And tears will dry as you're leaving. Who knows you might find something to last. A matter of feeling. A matter of feeling. (He comes to steal the world). A matter of feeling. (He comes and steal the world). A matter of feeling. (He comes and taste the blood). A matter of feeling
3048,Duran Duran,Rock,Meeting you with a view to a kill. Face to face in secret places feel the chill. Nightfall covers me but you know the plans I'm making. Still over sea could it be the whole earth opening wide. A sacred why a mystery gaping inside. The weekends why until we. Dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance in the the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams. Dance in to the fire that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire. Choice for you is the view to a kill. Between the shades assassination standing still. First crystal tears fall of snowflakes on your body. First time in years to drench your skin with lovers rosy stain. A chance to find a phoenix for the flame. A chance to die but can we. Dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams. Dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire. when all we see is the view to a kill

3051,Duran Duran,Rock,I never found out what made you leave. And now the day is over just an hour to go. I tried to phone last night but you did'nt answer. Just left me ringing on the line. Outside is there anyone out there anyone else outside. O-utside love is there anyone out there anyone else outside. My face in the mirror shows a break in time. A crack in the ocean which does not align. I tried to sleep last night but I've caught you dreaming. About days we used to wonder away. Outside is there anyone out there anyone else outside. O-utside love is there anyone out there anyone else outside. Look out of the window maybe you can call by my name. Another night over babe another light coves on in vain. Oh I tried to phone last night but you never answered. Just left me ringing in the air. Is there anyone out there. Anyone out there
3052,Duran Duran,Rock,To the voyeur. Sitting in a darkened room. Do you thrill. When the green light starts pulsing. Paranoia. The only valid point of view. If you know. What I'm saying. I'm not alone. Being followed. Someone always watching what we do. Never alone. But I'm in the shadows. I dream things I don't want you to know. Something shifting. Between the sirens and the glow. Of red lights. And the blue slowly turning. The fog is lifting. A silhouette begins to show. And the moment is stolen. I'm not alone. Being followed. Someone always watching what we do. Never alone. But I'm in the shadows. I dream things I don't want you to know. In this chamber. Lit by scandal. You're the bullet. In the barrel. You're the last thing. As I'm falling. Bloody roaring. Still I'm calling out. I'm calling out. I'm not alone. Being followed. Never alone. I'm being followed. I'm not alone. Being followed. Never alone. I'm being followed. La la la la la la la

Maybe I can catch a ride. I couldn't really put it much plainer. But I'll wait till you decide. Send me your warning siren. As if I could ever hide. Last time la luna. I light my torch. And wave it for the new moon on Monday. And a fire dance. Through the night. I stayed the cold day. With a lonely satellite. Breaking away. With the beast of both worlds. A smile that you can't disguise. Every minute I keep finding. Clues that you leave behind. Send me from these reminders. As if I'd forget tonight. This time la luna
3061,Duran Duran,Rock,Dark sun rose on the ridge cut clear across the sky. As good a day as any to die. No reservation madam. No reason to know why. Running late stiletto heels. Try to loosen up the wheels. You spend your life in preparation for this day. Breathe in the air; it's loaded with fame. Check out those weapons sister before you hit the fray. String of pearls meet bits of gems. Enter the battle of the lenses. Red carpet massacre. Don't want to hassle you. Red carpet massacre. Deathstalk papparazzi yeah. Red carpet massacre. It's going to mess with you. We're in business. You're on the hit list. There's not so many now still standing on their feet. Their knives are out and singing so sweet. Engage with sharper minds that cut you when you meet. Anyplace to mess around. When someone wants to take you down. Maybe you think you're above this. But baby we know that you love it. Baby you know where to shove it. Apply your lipstick. 'Fore dying in public. Red carpet massacre. Don't want to hassle you. Red carpet massacre. Deathstalk papparazzi yeah. Red carpet massacre. Don't want to mess with you. Now it's time. Next in line. We're so busted. Done and dusted
3062,Duran Duran,Rock,5. shotgun. Get it together. Thing is jumpin'. I wanna see your. Bullets pumpin'. Shotgun. Itchy finger. On the trigger. Got to make the. Shooter bigger. Shotgun.
3063,Duran Duran,Rock,You shine. Where others fade. You dare to be so brave. Don't compromise. No one can hurt you. Just believe. Just believe. Come to heaven. Silva halo. Come to heaven. Silva halo. Silva halo...
3064,Duran Duran,Rock,Those tears on a gaping voice. Who's stretching arms match the hunger of mine. There lips will they never join. But always draw me closer and further entwined. With a promise dealer understand all freedoms fade away. To a point of view where many different pathways meet. And we're standing on this precipice with nothing much to save. But the deep blue screams of falling dreams with our next move. Heaven hide your eyes (heaven hide your eyes). Heaven's eyes will never dry (heaven's eyes will never dry). . The shades of a thousand steel. Come flashing by my face in the fury of war. In desolation and abandoned fields. The hungry make their stand when they'll stand for no more. Hear the passion in their voices see the heaven in their eyes. Their hopes and schemes are waiting dreams of less than paradise. And sometimes we make promises we never mean to keep. For blackmail is the only deal a promise dealer sees. . (chorus) (chorus). (chorus) (chorus) (chorus).
3065,Duran Duran,Rock,These are days of hit and run. In the stream with everyone. Is a moment of our lives. On a wandering river. Going on together. Many journeys to arrive. I've been walking. Through the valley. Through the tall grass. And the shadows. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. Through the city. And the towers. Turning minutes. Into hours. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. When I think I'm being strong. And I lose direction. then a life starts looking mischievous. Finding revelation. Out of desperation. Always stretching time. But it's never long enough. You think you're happy. Think you're free. But maybe we're just. Comfortably dizzy. I've been running. Through the valley. Through the tall grass. And the shadows. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. Through the city. And the towers. Turning minutes. Into hours. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. I've been running. Through the valley. Through the tall grass. Through the shadows. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it. Through the city. And the towers. Turning minutes. Into hours. And I feel it. I can see it. Yes I need it. I believe it
3066,Duran Duran,Rock,When your nine day feed is up. And you've drained your loving cup. Come stands reeling to the shore. When the brave are coming out. The dry fight and the dusty shout. See you crawling on the floor. And diamond stars shine glitter bright. Gorging your sanhedralite. Words are falling to the floor. Glands stand pouring fruit tree. Now they glisten on the waterline. See how you are at the shore. I'm moving chrissie pretty flowers in the shutter maze. Haul up all your petty desires. Leave it lying down before. Wash away the rusty disease. Of your brown town days in our silver sea. Leave it dying at the door. Feather yell you've time to leave. Open out your arms and breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
3067,Duran Duran,Rock,[instrumental]
3068,Duran Duran,Rock,We are undergoing treatment. Watching others in the news. Studying our worst reviews. They say we'll get over it. Disappear like dinosaurs. To the sound of sole applause. Designed to make us special. If you see me walking in the garden. Don't ever ask me for an autograph. If you ever catch me in the arcade. Don't even stop me for a photograph. We are undergoing treatment. Till our ethic fits the scene. Layed out in Q Magazine. They crave our conformity. Mediocre to the bone. Terrified testosterone. But why do we still face the music. If you see me walking in the garden. Don't ever ask me... Now and then you get the strangest notion. That there's something missing. But it keeps you guessing. Wild ambition can you really blame us?. Can you entertain us?. Can you give a little more?. (chorus). We are undergoing treatment. Will the doctors ever cure. These delusions of grandeur?.
3069,Duran Duran,Rock,I'm giving you the news. Your domination's through. You gave the best you've got. Now I'm out on top. If you're in any doubt. Listen to me. I've got a right to say. If you know what it's all about. Who do you think you are?. . Don't wanna be your enemy. If I'm not the one you want me to be. And I've gotta do things the way that I do. Always trying to control. Who do you think you are?. . Our time on earth is running through. (It's not a question of my pride). Sometimes I think it's a game to you. (You wonder how to feel inside). Sometimes I play along. But man I've got a mind!. You've gotta live with yourself. For the rest of you life. Do you understand?. Everybody asks the same question. Who do you think you are?. Why do feel ashamed. When you can't explain the things I say. To other people. This just occurred to me. A possibility. The thought that you might really want to be me.
3070,Duran Duran,Rock,Zooming in. Stood on the line. You understand. I've been waiting forever. Come rain come shine. In the wind in the snow. In the filty weather. You've got it all worked out. Ya but it knocks you out. But I'm zooming in. Now she arrives. In a flaming crash. Like a falling star. Heading straight for the dive. Gonna make some cash. With the avatar. You got it all worked out. I know you know. I don't want you to go. Ya but it knocks you out. I'm zooming in on you on you. Don't look back you�re a heart attack x 4. You've got it all worked out. Ya but it knocks you out. We're not alone. In the 2nd life. There are millions like us. Right here. In the stones. In the air too bright. All the new insiders. You've got it all worked out. I know you know. I don't want you to go. Ya but it knocks you out. I'm zooming in on you on you. Na na na na na na. I know you know. I don't want you to go. Na na na na na na. I'm zooming in and out on you
3071,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,Under blue moon I saw you. So soon you'll take me. Up in your arms. Too late to beg you or cancel it. Though I know it must be. The killing time. Unwillingly mine. Fate. Up against your will. Through the thick and thin. He will wait until. You give yourself to him. In starlit nights I saw you. So cruelly you kissed me. Your lips a magic world. Your sky all hung with jewels. The killing moon. Will come too soon. Fate. Up against your will. Through the thick and thin. He will wait until. You give yourself to him. Under blue moon I saw you. So soon you'll take me. Up in your arms. Too late to beg you or cancel it. Though I know it must be the killing time. Unwillingly mine. Fate. Up against your will. Through the thick and thin.

3073,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,I want it now I want it now not. the promises of what tomorrow brings. I need to live in dreams today. I'm tired of the song that sorrow sings. I want more than I can get just. trying to trying to trying to forget. I walk to you through winds of fire. and never let you know the way I feel. Under skin is where I hide love. that always gets me on my knees. I want more than I can get just. trying to trying to trying to forget. Nothing ever lasts forever nothing ever lasts. forever nothing ever lasts. forever nothing ever lasts forever. I want it now I want it now don't. tell me that my ship is coming in.

3075,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,A sense of duty. Was my one intention. And an ugly beauty. Was my own invention. Pride a proud refusal. And i refuse. To need your approval. Too many seekers. Too few beacons. But through the fog. We'll keep on beaming. Through the crying hours. Of your glitter years. All the living out. Of your tinsel tears. And the midnight trains. I never made. 'cos i'd already. Played...the game. Everybody's. Got their own good reason. Why their favorite season. Is their favorite season. Winter winners. And those summers sons. Aren't good for everyone. Aren't good for everyone. Spring has sprung. And autumns well done. So well done. And it's a better thing. That we do now. Forgetting everything. The whys and hows. While you reminisce. About the things you miss. You won't be ready. To kiss...goodbye. The earth is a world. The world is a ball. A ball in a game. With no rules at all. And just as i wonder. At the beauty of it all. You go and drop it. And it breaks and falls. I'll never understand. Why you thought i would. Need to be reassured. And be understood. When i always knew. That your bad's my good. And i was ready. Ready...to be loved. Born under mars. With jupiter rising. Fallen from stars. That lit my horizon. I'll never understand. Why you thought i would. Need to be reassured. And be understood. When i always knew. That your bad's my good. And i was ready. Ready...to be. Through the crying hours. Of your glitter years. All the living out. Of your tinsel tears. And the midnight trains. I never made. 'cos i'd already. Played. It's a better thing. That we do now. Forgetting everything. The whys and hows. While you reminisce. About the things you miss. You won't be ready. To kiss...goodbye

3081,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,Swung from a chandelier. My planet sweet on a silver salver. Bailed out my worst fears. 'Cause man has to be his own saviour. Blind sailors. Imprisoned jailers. God tame us. No one to blame us. The sky is blue. My hands untied. A world that's true. Through our clean eyes. Just look at you. With burning lips. You're living proof. At my fingertips. Walked on a tidal wave. Laughed in the face of a brand new day. Food for survival thought. Mapped out the place where I planned to stay. All the way. Well behaved. Just in case. It slips away. The sky is blue. My hands untied. A world that's true. Through our clean eyes. Just look at you. With burning lips. You're living proof. At my fingertips. La la la la la la la la la la la la la.

3082,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,My White Devil. John Webster was. One of the best there was. He was the author of. Two major tragedies. The White Devil and. The Duchess of Malfi. The White Devil and. The Duchess of Malfi. Change in the nether. Do I get the choice. Chance in forever. When do we get the spoils. Now that love is upside-down. It's down to us to say that. Our monkey brains. Content to laugh. When laughing wanes. It's time to change. Make on the when. I will be then. You on the then. We will be then. Here it comes again. Knocking on its feet. (x2). Don't say it's life on the barrier (x3). Is it enough now. To tell me you matter. When you haven't a clue how. To bring me to tears. How many leaves must you crumble. Till you believe what I told you. That's a (??) a stumble. (? ? ? ? ?). Change in the nether. Do I get the choice. Chance it forever. When do we get the spoils
3083,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,If i knew now what i knew then. I'd wonder how not wonder when. There's something going wrong again. With me and mine. It's only ever what it seems. Memories and might have beens. Heaven's scent: the smell of dreams. We'll never find. Tell me... tell me... tell me.... What are you going to do with your life?. What are you going to do with your life?. What are you going to do?. What are you going to be?. What am i going to do?. I'm going to be me be me be me. If i could see what you can see. The sun still shining out of me. I'd be the boy i used to be. When love was blind. I'd let the light back in again. And walk you to the tunnel's end. I'll be yours and maybe then. You'll be mine. Tell me... tell me... tell me.... I will if you will... follow me down
3084,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,Seven Seas. Stab a sorry heart. With your favourite finger. Paint the whole world blue. And stop your tears from stinging. Hear the cavemen singing. Good news they're bringing. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise shell. A longing for. Some fresher feeling. Belonging. Or just forever kneeling. Where is the sense in stealing. Without the grace to be it. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise shell. Burning my bridges. And smashing my mirrors. Turning to see if you're cowardly. Burning the witches with mother religious. You'll strike the matches and shower me. In water games. Washing the rocks below. Taught and tamed. In time with tear flow. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise shell. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise shell

3086,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,I'd be bad to feel so bad. Waking up like thing so red. Up and down and down the stairs. Set myself up in the chin. And said all I love is all I love.

'cos i'd already. Played...the game. Everybody's. Got their own good reason. Why their favorite season. Is their favorite season. Winter winners. And those summers sons. Aren't good for everyone. Aren't good for everyone. Spring has sprung. And autumns well done. So well done. And it's a better thing. That we do now. Forgetting everything. The whys and hows. While you reminisce. About the things you miss. You won't be ready. To kiss...goodbye. The earth is a world. The world is a ball. A ball in a game. With no rules at all. And just as i wonder. At the beauty of it all. You go and drop it. And it breaks and falls. I'll never understand. Why you thought i would. Need to be reassured. And be understood. When i always knew. That your bad's my good. And i was ready. Ready...to be loved. Born under mars. With jupiter rising. Fallen from stars. That lit my horizon. I'll never understand. Why you thought i would. Need to be reassured. And be understood. When i always knew. That your bad's my good. And i was ready. Ready...to be. Through the crying hours. Of your glitter years. All the living out. Of your tinsel tears. And the midnight trains. I never made. 'cos i'd already. Played. It's a better thing. That we do now. Forgetting everything. The whys and hows. While you reminisce. About the things you miss. You won't be ready. To kiss...goodbye
3122,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,Under blue moon I saw you. So soon you'll take me. Up in your arms. Too late to beg you or cancel it. Though I know it must be. The killing time. Unwillingly mine. Fate. Up against your will. Through the thick and thin. He will wait until. You give yourself to him. In starlit nights I saw you. So cruelly you kissed me. Your lips a magic world. Your sky all hung with jewels. The killing moon. Will come too soon. Fate. Up against your will. Through the thick and thin. He will wait until. You give yourself to him. Under blue moon I saw you. So soon you'll take me. Up in your arms. Too late to beg you or cancel it. Though I know it must be the killing time. Unwillingly mine. Fate. Up against your will. Through the thick and thin. He will wait until. You give yourself to him. Fate. Up against your will. Through the thick and thin. He will wait until. You give yourself to him. You give yourself to him
3123,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,The Puppet. I'll practice my fall. For practice makes perfect. Chained to the wall. For maximum hold. The window's so far. Too far from my legs. Open the door and let out the cold. Chorus:. You knew about this. With your head in your hands. All along. I was the puppet. I was the puppet. Trampolines broken. Ceiling has come down. The ache in my back tells me. Something's gone wrong. Rocking horse rocks. As the wallpaper peels. Curtain would like to know. What he has done. (chorus). We're the salt of the earth. (I'll practice my fall for practice makes perfect). And we know what to say. (Chained to the wall for maximum hold). We're the salt of the earth. (The window's so far too far from my legs). And we know our place. (Open the door and let out the cold). (chorus). All along. (You knew about this). With your head in your hands. All along. (You knew about this). I was the puppet (x2). (You knew about this). Head in your hands. (You knew about this). I was the puppet (x2). (We're the salt of the earth). You knew about this. (We know what to say). Your head in your hands. (We're the salt of the earth). All along. ((You knew about this)). (We know a place). I was the puppet. (We're the salt of the earth). All along. (We know what to say). ((You knew about this)). Your head in your hands. (We're the salt of the earth). I was the puppet. ((You knew about this)). (We know what to say). I was the puppet
3124,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,Must've forgotten something. How to forget how to be true. Covered myself in nothing. Don't touch me and i won't touch you. Tryin' to remember something. Why am I here and who are you?. You must admit something. Animals came in two by two. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. I think I need it too. I think I need it too. I think I need it too. Just as I thought I'm thinking. How can I change when I don't want to. Kept getting caught. Kept drinking. How can I blame what I got to. Putting the wheels in motion. Autopilot I can't drive. [ Echo & the Bunnymen Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]. Covered in chalomine lotion. Scratching my ?? bee stung. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. I think I need it too. I think I need it too. I think I need it too. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. I think I need it too. I think I need it too. I think I need it too
3125,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,Turquoise Days. Just when the thought occurs. The panic will pass. And the smell of the fields. Never lasts. Put your faith. In those crimson nights. Set sail. In those turquoise days. Chorus:. You've got a problem. Come on over. (x2). It's not for glory. It's not for honour. Just something someone said. It's not for love. It's not for war. Just hands clasped together. It's not for living. It's for hunger. Just lips locked tight. It's not rebellion. It's not suffering. It's just the way it is. And my duffel's packed. And my goggles with me. I feel easy. And I want it. And I need it. And I've got it. It's not for this. It's not for that. It's not any of it. Did you say knowledge?. Did you say prayer?. Did you say anything?. If not for good. If not for better. If not the way it is. Just when the thought occurs. The panic will pass. And the smell of the fields. Never lasts. We'll put your faith. In those crimson nights. Set sail. In those turquoise days. Place our faith. In those crimson nights. Set sail. In those turquoise days. (chorus). Now I think I know. Just what to say. (x2)
3126,Echo And The Bunnymen,Rock,If i knew now what i knew then. I'd wonder how not wonder when. There's something going wrong again. With me and mine. It's only ever what it seems. Memories and might have beens. Heaven's scent: the smell of dreams. We'll never find. Tell me... tell me... tell me.... What are you going to do with your life?. What are you going to do with your life?. What are you going to do?. What are you going to be?. What am i going to do?. I'm going to be me be me be me. If i could see what you can see. The sun still shining out of me. I'd be the boy i used to be. When love was blind. I'd let the light back in again. And walk you to the tunnel's end. I'll be yours and maybe then. You'll be mine. Tell me... tell me... tell me.... I will if you will... follow me down
3127,Eddie Vedder,Rock,When I walk beside her. I am the better man. When I look to leave her. I always stagger back again. Once I built an ivory tower. So I could worship from above. When I climb down to be set free. She took me in again. There's a big. A big hard sun. Beating on the big people. In the big hard world. When she comes to greet me. She is mercy at my feet. When I see her pin her charm. She just throws it back at me. Once I dug an early grave. To find a better land. She just smiled and laughed at me. And took her blues back again. There's a big. A big hard sun. Beating on the big people. In the big hard world. When I go to cross that river. She is comfort by my side. When I try to understand. She just opens up her hands. There's a big. A big hard sun. Beating on the big people. In the big hard world. Once I stood to lose her. When I saw what I had done. Bowed down and threw away the hours. Of her garden and her sun. So I tried to want her. I turned to see her weep. Forty days and forty nights. And it's still coming down on me. There's a big. A big hard sun. Beating on the big people. In the big hard world
3128,Eddie Vedder,Rock,Such is the way of the world. You can never know. Just where to put all your faith. And how will it grow. Gonna rise up. Bringing black holes and dark memories. Gonna rise up. Turning mistakes into gold. Such is the passage of time. Too fast to fold. And suddenly swallowed by signs. lo and behold. Gonna rise up. Find my direction magnetically. Gonna rise up. Throw down my ace in the hole
3129,Eddie Vedder,Rock,I won't be the last. I won't be the first. Find a way to where the sky meets the earth. It's all right and all wrong. For me it begins at the end of the road. We come and go...
3130,Eddie Vedder,Rock,Have no fear. For when I'm alone. I'll be better off than I was before. I've got this life. I'll be around to grow. Who I was before. I cannot recall. Long nights allow me to feel.... I'm falling...I am falling. The lights go out. Let me feel. I'm falling. I am falling safely to the ground. Ah.... I'll take this soul that's inside me now. Like a brand new friend. I'll forever know. I've got this light. And the will to show. I will always be better than before. Long nights allow me to feel.... I'm falling...I am falling. The lights go out. Let me feel. I'm falling. I am falling safely to the ground. Ah...

3133,Eddie Vedder,Rock,You are the hole in my head. I am the pain in your neck. You are the lump in my throat. I am the aching in your heart. We are tangled. We are stolen. We are living where things are hidden. You are something in my eye. I am the shiver down your spine. You are on the lick of my lips. And I am on the tip of your tongue. We are tangled. We are stolen. We are buried up to our necks in sand. We are luck. We are fate. We are the feeling you get in the Golden State. We are love. We are hate. We are the feeling I get when you walk away. Walk away. You are the dream in my nightmare. I am that falling sensation. You are not needles and pills. I am your hangover morning. We are tangled. We are stolen. We are living where things are hidden. We are luck. We are fate. We are the feeling you get in the Golden State. We are love. We are hate. We are the feeling I get when you walk away. Walk away. Walk away. You are the hole in my head. You are the lump in my throat. You are the pain in my neck. I am the aching in your heart

3137,Eddie Vedder,Rock,Once in a while will you try to give. One little thought to me. Though someone else may be. Nearer your heart?. Once in a while will you dream. Of the moments I shared with you. Moments before we two. Drifted apart?. In love's smoldering ember. One spark may remain. If love still can remember. That spark may burn again. I know that I'll be contented. With yesterday's memory. Knowing you think of me. Once in a while. In love's smoldering ember. One spark may remain. If love still can remember. The spark may burn again. I know that I'll be contented. With yesterday's memory. Knowing you think of me. Once in a while

3145,Elbow,Rock,Were you crushed. Did I rush you. All my time is yours. My twisted heart is yours. The faithless shit is yours. The shameless fits of love that only smother you for moments. Until I fold them up and leave. All yours. (chorus). Oh you had to ask didn't you (x2). Oh you had to know. Show your scars. Not to rush you. The hieroglyphic hints in all the toilet scrawl. Guilty little pins. And all the things I never talk about. Are spilling with the gin. Test how tough you are. All yours. (chorus).
3146,Elbow,Rock,Brave New Shave. You say the words. Where are you. Do not disturb. The words are young. But your deal is done. We can take so much of you. Only take so much of you. Show your tricks. You've got the moves. Throw your shapes. Know what to prove. Your spring is sprung. And your grin is gone. We can take so much of you. Only take so much of you
3147,Elbow,Rock,Can't stop thinking. I won't stop drinking. I need that comfort. I don't need discipline. Twilights tailing. I had self belief (They don't compromise). This has battered me. That's my history. Hold this shaking frame. Pull this back together. What's your story?. I want to listen.. I can't fake pity.. I may not sympathize. Twilights tailing.. Try my lies for size. You might swallow them. While I fantasize. Try-my-lies-for-size..
3148,Elbow,Rock,It's crawling with idiot. I'm itching to leave. I'm soft with fatigue I need something. I've never seen anything quite like you. In here. Chorus. Come on it's not serious. I just need arms tonight. You're blue collar pride. And you're loose cotton cool. You're wilting a little. Nothing grows down here. Chrome. Smoke. Heat.
3149,Elbow,Rock,All the fallen angels. Roostin' in this place. Count back the weeks on worried fingers. Virgin mother whats'erface. Chorus. You don't need to sleep alone. You bring the house down. Choose your favourite shoes. And keep your blues on cruise control. All the gelded mongrel. Bear their teeth for you. Drag your feathers 'cross the dancefloor. Throw your shapes electric blue.
3150,Elbow,Rock,Flying dream 143. I stretched out my arms. And my feet left the floor. And how all fifteen (ahem) stone flew to you.
3151,Elbow,Rock,Before leaving get to the bar. No one round here makes you pay. Never very good at goodbyes. So gentle shoulder charge. Love you mate. Love you mate. Salford skyline gloom. Always you. Could fly round any corner. But until you do. Love you mate
3152,Elbow,Rock,Lost in a lullaby. Side of the road. Melt in a memory. Slide in a solitude. Not 'til I can read by the moon. Am I going anywhere. Not 'til I can read by the moon. Chorus. I blow you a kiss. It should reach you tomorrow. As it flies from the other side of the world. From my room in my fugitive motel. Somewhere in the dust bowl. It flies from the other side of the world. 'I'm tired' I said. 'You always look tired' she said. 'I'm admired' I said. 'You always look tired' she said. Not 'til I can read by the moon. Am I going anywhere. Not 'til I can read by the moon. Curtains stay closed. But everyone knows. You hear through the walls in this place. Cigarette holes for every lost soul. To give up the ghost in this place. Give me strength.
3153,Elbow,Rock,Borrowed air a baby breathes. Falling helicopter seed. I forget which tree. Advice from friends less drunk than me. A falling helicopter seed. I forget which tree. Borrowed air a baby yawns. Kiss that doesn't wake you up. Borrowed air a baby breathes. A falling helicopter seed. I forget which tree
3154,Elbow,Rock,Grace under pressure. Cooling palm across my brow. Eyes of an angel. Lay me down.
3155,Elbow,Rock,"""Mondays is for drinking. To the seldom seen kid. I've been working. On a cocktail called. """"Grounds For Divorce"""". Whoah. Polishing a compass. That I hold in my sleeve. Whoah. Down comes him on sticks. But then he kicks. Like a horse. Whoah. There's a Chinese cigarette case. And the rest you can keep. And the rest you can keep. And the rest you can keep. There's a hole. In my neighborhood. Down which of late. I cannot help but fall. There's a hole. In my neighborhood. Down which of late. I cannot help but fall. Mondays is for drinking. To the seldom seen kid. There's this. Whispering of jokers. Doing """"Flesh by the Pound"""". To a chorus of supporters. From the little town halls. There'll be twisted karaoke. At the Aniseed Lounge. And I'll bring you. Further roses. But it does you no good. And it does me no good. And it does you no good. There's a hole. In my neighborhood. Down which of late. I cannot help but fall. There's a hole. In my neighborhood. Ddown which of late. I cannot help but fall. There's a hole. In my neighborhood. Down which of late. I cannot help but fall. There's a hole. In my neighborhood. Down which of late. I cannot help but fall. Someday we'll be drinking. With the seldom seen kid"""
3156,Elbow,Rock,Across the city there's a golden chill. A rare holding still. As if somebody's gonna sing. A dip in tempo for the castanet shoes. No blues and twos. As if somebody's gonna sing. And in the moment hanging on to you. We're a bundle of clothes and shoes. Whatever we could find. You are the reason for this missing beat. On the streets that I love. And in me. Now I'm here at your side. We try to rhyme our stride. And head for supplies. Way down inside me was a pilot light. That good friends tended. And fed with tiny kindnesses. And there was comfort. In a stranger's bed from time to time. It has to be said it just reminded us. The brief ignition of a hopeful flame. But there and then gone. It wasn't the same and then a rostrum struck. The way you read me like you wrote this book. And chapters along it's still in your eyes. Now I'm here at your side. As though. The street. That meets our feet might know. We try to rhyme our stride. And head for supplies. Across the city there's a golden chill. A rare holding still. As if somebody's gonna sing. A dip in tempo for the castanet shoes. No blues and twos. As if somebody's gonna sing. We glide. We spin. You end and I begin. I made this mess for you. To sift through for all time. You're glowing from within. Beneath an autumn sky. We find our rhyming stride. And head for supplies
3157,Elbow,Rock,Don't put this note by your face on the pillow. Don't put this letter in the pocket near your heart. Keep it in the bottom drawer where you hide the sex tools. I pray you always need them. Chorus. I know what you have done. Throwing advice like grenades at the table. You're spinning your wisdom in stories that change. Your lies are fluorescent my babyfaced angel. Grow a fucking heart love. Chorus. I know what you have done. I've got your number.
3158,Elbow,Rock,I have a drop-leaf window. With cats and broken yards. Sunflowers and paint cans. And stolen shopping carts. And nothing to be proud of. And nothing to regret. All of that to make as yet. All of that to make as yet. I have a single heartbreak. I celebrate and mourn. A single shining sister. And all the tricks of dawn. A single yellow duvet. A single switch to flick. But a thousand boxes yet to tick. A thousand boxes yet to tick. And Jesus is a Rochdale girl. And forty-five CDs. Got a house that you can smoke in. So all my friends found me. And they found me full of myself. And bloody-minded will. And as yet a box to fill. And as yet a box to fill
3159,Elbow,Rock,The whole towns slippin down a hill.. Like the spine of something dead.. Slide in shadow cobble-creep.. Burn your mark and leave.. The trench conventions yellow eyes. Follow her the local flower. The girls a priest (to me at least). Since baptism peroxide.. And fear is not respect. Correct.. But it's the best you're gonna get. Sharp blow to the bridge of the nose.
3160,Elbow,Rock,A muffled battle cry across the kitchen table. A baffling contretemps. That shakes the day unstable. Confessions from the cab a habit. That I got from dad. The flurry of departure. In a cyclone of cologne. Would often devastate the gate and hedge. And set our tiny teeth on edge. I see it in me now and pledge. To knock it on the head that's what I'll do. A muffled battle cry across the kitchen table. Bridges up portcullis down. And round the tower of babel. I'm babbling in my dreams. Of blue berserkers coming at me. Eyes and tongues and rusty knives. And god almighty laughing at me. From a fat boy fishing chair. I wake to find you laughing there. It's nice to know how much you care. Decided I should spend my life with you. We protect our little fictions. Like it's all we are. Little wilderness mementos. But there's only you and me here. Fire breathing. Hold tight. Waiting for the original miracle. I'm trying to focus. On the issues of the day please. Your paper's upside down. The radio's in chinese. These little tremors. That are ripping through our rituals. That friction up the interaction. Emanate from quite the greatest. Thing that ever happened to. A pair of boozy bowerbirds. Like me and you. In other words. The alligator pear inside of you. We protect our little fictions. When we bow to fear. Little wilderness mementos. But there's only you and me here. Fire breathing. Hold tight. Waiting for the original miracle. Fire breathing. Hold tight. Life is the original miracle. Let's get old. Dare you now. Mix blood with me. All in. Love is the original miracle. Let's get old. Dare you now. Mix blood with me. All in. Love is the original miracle. Love is the original miracle
3161,Elbow,Rock,Loss took human form. He sits at every table and he doesn't eat a thing. Stands at the piano and he never sings. He must be 6' tall. I'd have recognised his footsteps anywhere at all. He used to throw me round the room. Roads lead to roads lead to. He won't leave me alone. Loss took human form. Tried to introduce me to a friend. The end
3162,Elbow,Rock,Someone's staking out my house. So don't be sitting drunk. Outside my window. 'cause when your love is love blown down. You must live with yourself. Someone's opening my mail. So don't be sending us it through the post. Someone's is tapping my phone you know?. So stop your crank calls telling me you love me. When your love is love blown down. You must live with yourself. 'cause when your love is love blown down. You must sleep so your head can escape your heart
3163,Elbow,Rock,Rest. Head. Strong. Brother. Rest. Heart. Sleeve. Brother. Sleeve. Now. Press. Brother. Dawn. Brings. Love. Lasting. Cry. No. More. Brother. Sleep. Sleeve. Sleeve. Sleep
3164,Elbow,Rock,Hurt and baffled. I simmer and freeze. I'm squeezing my words. Like I'm icing a bomb. Blame me if it gets you to sleep. But mind how you go. As you get 'til you're gone. Your heart could easy power three of me. Should my love get lost in the delivery. May brings a supermoon gold and relentless. And the dog bats of melbourne fall from the blue. Swerving casinos and swatting at memories of you. Don't talk like we were stuck in a lift. Why would I be missing you so violently. We're all the hero when directing the scene. But therapy for liars is a giant ice cream. Your heart could easy power three of me. Should my love get lost in the delivery. The lights on your father's bridge on the harbour. Montparnasse dawn for the sleepless insane. Caught in our personal rain again and again. Serious love for the longest of lives. Not a regret when these mumbles are through. Gatecrashing weddings. And swatting at memories of you
3165,Elbow,Rock,Pull the final splinters. Of missing picture winters. You have to give yourself a break. What's the fascination. With lovers at the station. You have to tear yourself away. Chorus. The dream again nobody understands. Walking through the long grass on your hands. It's not a job to do today. Sleep it off. Words to make her stay: you said. Leave me and the plants die. A panic smile across your face. Corrugated browline. The hissing bitter punchline. Call when you can tie your lace. You rule my world my brother.
3166,Elbow,Rock,Drinking. In order to feel. Thinking. Reinventing the wheel. Kicking up mischief. And feeding the fire. Kicking up mischief. And walking the wire. Little fish you count for nothing. Do your thing until you die. Keep your powder dry. In order and line. Thinking and sinking the wine. Kicking up mischief and feeding the fire. Kicking up mischief and walking the wire. Little fish just keep on flapping. Do your thing until you die. Keep your powder dry
3167,Elbow,Rock,My brother fear is only natural. You need to chill your fucking bones. You will feel Christ-like. When it's breathing in and out.
3168,Elbow,Rock,I leaned on you today. I regularly hurt but never say. I nearly wore the window through. Where was air sea rescue?. The cavalry with tea and sympathy. You were there. Puncture repair. I leaned on you today. I regularly hurt but never say. You patched me up and sent me on my way. I leaned on you today
3169,Elbow,Rock,We blew the doors didn't we?. Pissed in their champagne. And did a real thing didn't we?. Gave ourselves a name. And peeled away the shame. I wanted to explode. To pull my ribs apart. And let the sun inside. Red stain blossoms. And all you have is kisses. And when the sunshine. Throwin' me a lifeline. Finds it's way into my room. All I need is you. We called that love. All you have is kisses.
3170,Elbow,Rock,Been climbing trees I've skinned my knees. My hands are black the sun is going down. She scruffs my hair in the kitchen steam. She's listening to the dream I weaved today. Crosswords through the bathroom door. While someone sings the theme-tune to the news. And my sister buzzes through the room leaving perfume in the air. And that's what triggered this.. I come back here from time to time. I shelter here some days.. A high-back chair. He sits and stares. A thousand yards and whistles. Marching-band (Boom-ching). Kneeling by and speaking up. He reaches out and I take a. Massive hand. Disjointed tales. That flit between short trousers. And a full dress uniform. And he talks of people ten years. Gone like I've known them all my life.
3171,Elbow,Rock,Stuff was started. Things had ends. Stuff regarding all my friends. Some were married. All were fine. These are good friends these are mine. Chorus. I got deep warm drunk. And I lost my words. And it does not hurt. And that moon isâ€¦.
3172,Elbow,Rock,Tied this letter to the red balloon. Flew this letter off across the ruse. Along with all the plans I made. Ooh.... Over crippled cranes and twisted steel. Deadlines overgrown and missing wheels. I told you so communicate. Ooh.... Told you so. Told you so. The biggest of mistakes can be forgiven. But a snowball of little white lies will crush your house. From the razor wire in old Iraq. Oil is what you make the nation's flag. Pray you never sleep again. Ooh.... Oh and laughable the crying shame. Oh the mark I made against your name. I hope this finds you less than sane. Ooh.... Told you so. Told you so. For you to think that history's rewritten. You'd have to think the dead will be forgotten. Your snowball of little white lies has crushed our house. When the pills you take. No longer help you. You're fading in your chair. And would've met him. We see the lightning. You hear the birdsong. You hear the voices you've been holding off for so long. Words around you. And then a hurricane. A hundred thousand souls. And everyone in pain. We'll come and visit you. We'll come and visit you. (Never sleep again). When the pills you take. No longer help you. Fading in your garden chair. With a wooden tool. You see the lightning. You'll hear the birdsong. You hear the voices you've been holding off for so long. Words around you. And then a hurricane. A hundred thousand punctured souls. And everyone in pain. We'll come and visit you. We'll come and visit you. (Never sleep again)
3173,Elbow,Rock,I haven’t been myself of late. I haven’t slept for several days but. Coming home I feel like I. Designed these buildings I walk by. You know you drive me up the wall. I need to see your face that’s all. You little sod I love your eyes. Be everything to me tonight. The streets are full of Goths and Greeks. I haven’t seen my mum for weeks but. Coming home I feel like I. Designed these buildings I walk by. You know you drive me up the wall. I need to see your face that’s all. You little sod I love your eyes. Be everything to me tonight. I never know what I want but I know when. I’m low that I need to be in the town. Where they know what I’m like and don’t mind
3174,Elbow,Rock,The birds are the keepers of our secret. As they saw us where we lay. In the deepest grass of springtime. In a reckless guilty haze. Did they sing a million blessings. As they watched us slowly part?. Do they keep those final kisses. In their tiny racing hearts
3175,Elbow,Rock,Here's my advice avoid the noon. Don't listen to your favourite tunes. I've been there before. Heartbreak is such a bore. Fade up your smile and mute the pain. Let's fuck off round the world again. I've been there before. And mine is an open door. The boys are assembled here. And it's high time you tried a beer
3176,Elbow,Rock,I just don't trust the sun to rise. When I can't see your eyes. You're my reason for breathing. The napkin inks the words away. My numb dismay is deafening. I forget to blink. And I used to love a bar. Full of flickering stars. Far from home. But I'm pressing down an anger in my bones. Though if he came. Within swinging distance sonny jim. I would still go for the hold. It's cold in chicago. I just don't trust the sun to rise. When I can't see your eyes. You're my reason for breathing. Archipelago go gone. We pushed the boat out far too far this time. Something we dared never dream on tv every day. Eye for an eye for an eye for an eye. For an eye for an eye for an eye. Can I register today I refuse to be afraid. There's a girl a world away. Who sees love in other people. I just don't trust the sun to rise. When I can't see your eyes. You're my reason for breathing. I just don't trust the world to spin. If I can't pull you in. You're my reason for breathing
3177,Elbow,Rock,Holy Bravado. Tinsel Mikado. Waving from windows. Nobody you know. I needed to see you. Remember the feeling. Strange what the sun through the trees through the window. Can do to you. Holy Bravado. Tinsel Mikado. Nobody you know. Sorry I called you. Sorry I called you. Someone who knew you
3178,Elbow,Rock,Best intentions. Bring joyless drought. Pack your hacksaw. Come bust me out. When your dentures prevent your smile. These adventures will. Fill your eyes with love. You've been going see-through. Could do with a little sun. I'd give my liver to see you. Abide and ride shotgun. A baccian scandal awaits me. Just can't do it alone. Your sweetheart probably hates me. But I'll send you home. Your dome filled up with love. Love will find you out. Be sure love will find you out. As anybody with a kind word. Would know. It's gonna find you. Fill your boots. Fill your spine. Fill your dome. Fill your eyes. WITH LOVE...
3179,Elvis Costello,Rock,Will you walk us uptown?. And wherever you go. You know we will follow. Will you walk us uptown?. And we'll stand in the light. Of your new killing ground. And we won't make a sound. Except to sing our sorrow. Will you walk us uptown?. While our tears run in torrents. To suffer in silence or pray for some solace. Will you wash away our sins. In the cross-fire and cross-currents. As you uncross your fingers. And take out some insurance. No matter what the price. It's your own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. Some hearts are sinking. And some hearts are a-flutter. Some scoop gold from the dirt in the gutter. Or swallow the earth. Pouring into your mouth. As they bury us upright saying. 'Everything's alright'. Will you walk us uptown?. Like some said that you could. We will feast on your flesh. And drink down your blood. Will you haul down that flag. And dishonour that vow. Cause we must not change. It's color now. Will you walk us uptown?. No matter what the price. Each crushed in the corner of their own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. That's always assuming. That you're partly divine and partly human. You're the king of our hearts. You're the clown with the drum. Will you walk us uptown?. If we promise not to run. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you gather us near. As cowards flee and traitors sneer. Keep a red flag flying. Keep a blue flag as well. And a white flag in case it all goes to hell
3180,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""I've been talking to the wall and it's been answering me. Oh darling how I miss you. I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness. I crave the silhouette of your kiss. With only the blue light of the TV on. Lip reading threats and false alarms. There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself. And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn. Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt. That it's you that I'm dreaming about. Do I have to draw you a diagram?. All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands. With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze. Checkmate in three moves in your heyday. But the girls don't listen to your line anymore. Now you're part of someone else. On the factory floor and you still say """"Wheres the action?"""". Now you manufacture happiness. And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction. (chorus). All you toy soldiers and scaremongers. Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder. In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before. Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly. You know I love you more than slightly. Although I've never said it like this before. (chorus)."""
3181,Elvis Costello,Rock,I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. It's amazin' what you will. find stripping paper. When you get down to the past. Back then we didn't have means. for fine decorations. So we painted while mixing wine. with flirtation. There in the mess of it all. He took me right there in the thrill. Not quite against my will. With my back to that rococo wall. We slipped right down to the floor. I can't close the door. he complimented my taste. I anointed his serious face. with wallpaper [pics?]. I wish we could laugh like that now. But what seemed to follow. That ended up hollow. [Was I there?]. Tear a strip or two. See what what came not much later. Here's a pony and a toy balloon. Behind the [violet?] all too soon. Here's the pencil of a measurin' mark. And the monsters you spied in the dark. Now I got no place in her heart. Let me go back to the start. I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. I've got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper
3182,Elvis Costello,Rock,Why must I be so lonely?. When so many people pass me by. I've been waiting for oh so long now. And yet I'm unable to answer why. I can't be made to give up now. Can you find room for me. in your heart somehow?. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved. I guess I'm a victim of loneliness. But why should this be my destiny?. A foolish man for a lot of my life. Shouldn't there be someone. Someone for me?. I hope and I pray some happy day. That I'll be around to hear you say. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved. .
3183,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""He thought he was the King of America. Where they pour Coca Cola just like vintage wine. Now I try hard not to become hysterical. But I'm not sure if I am laughing or crying. I wish that I could push a button. And talk in the past and not the present tense. And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear. Like it was common sense. It was a fine idea at the time. Now it's a brilliant mistake. She said that she was working for the ABC News. It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use. Her perfume was unspeakable. It lingered in the air. Like her artificial laughter. Her mementos of affairs. """"Oh"""" I said """"I see you know him"""". """"Isn't that very fortunate for you"""". And she showed me his calling card. He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two. He was a fine idea at the time. Now he's a brilliant mistake. He thought he was the King of America. But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams. A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals. The words of love in whispers. And the acts of love in screams. I wish that I could push a button. And talk in the past and not the present tense. And watch this lovin' feeling disappear. Like it was common sense. I was a fine idea at the time."""
3184,Elvis Costello,Rock,Thank you for the days. Those endless days those sacred days you gave me. I'm thinking of the days. I won't forget a single day believe me. I bless the light. I bless the light that shines on you believe me. And though you're gone. You're with me every single day believe me. Days I remember all my life. Days where you can't see wrong from right. You took my life. And then I knew that very soon you'd leave me. But it's alright. Now I'm not frightened of this world believe me. I wish today could be tomorrow. The night is dark. It just brings sorrow let it wait. Thank you for the days. Those endless days those sacred days you gave me. I'm thinking of the days. I won't forget a single day believe me. I bless the light. I bless the light that shines on you believe me. And though you're gone. You're with me every single day believe me. Days I remember all my life. Days where you can't see wrong from right. You took my life. And then I knew that very soon you'd leave me. But it's alright. Now I'm not frightened of this world believe me...days. Thank you for the days. Those endless days those sacred days you gave me. I'm thinking of the days. I won't forget a single day believe me. I bless the light. I bless the light that shines on you believe me. And though you're gone.
3185,Elvis Costello,Rock,Don't say a word. Don't say anything. Don't say a word. I'm not even listening. I read in the paper about their escape. They're just two BITTER kids WITH a bunch of sour grapes. You better watch your step. Watch who's knocking on your front door. Now you know that they're watching. What are you waiting for?. Think you're young and original. Get out before.... They get to watch your step. Ev'ry day is full of fun. And family spies. They're making heroes out of fall guys. They say it's good for business. From Singapore to Widnes. You better watch your step. Broken noses hung up on the wall. Back slapping drinkers cheer the heavy weight brawl. So punch drunk they don't understand at all. You better watch your step. Ev'ry night. Go out full of carnival desires. End up in the closing time choirs. When you're kicking in the courtroom. And you're drinking down the Eau de Cologne. And you're spitting out the Kodachrome. You better watch your step. Bye. I send you all my regards. You're so tough. You're so hard. Listen to the hammers falling in the breaker's yard. You better watch your step. You better watch your step.
3186,Elvis Costello,Rock,What do you get when you fall in love?. A girl with a pin to burst your bubble. That's what you get for all your trouble. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. What do you get when you kiss a girl?. You get enough germs to catch pneumonia. After you do she'll never phone you. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. Don't tell me what it's all about. 'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out. Out of those chains those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you. What do you get when you give your heart?. You get it all broken up and battered. That's what you get a heart that's shattered. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. Out of those chains those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you. What do you get when you fall in love?. You only get lies and pain and sorrow. So for at least until tomorrow. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again.
3187,Elvis Costello,Rock,Some things you never get used to. Even though you're feeling like another man. There's nothing that he can do for you. To shut me away as you walk through. Lovers laughing in their amateur hour. Holding hands in the corridors of power. Even though I'm with somebody else right now. High fidelity. Can you hear me?. There's a new kind of dedication. Maybe you'll find it down the tunnel. Maybe I got above my station. Maybe you're only changing channel. Even though you're nowhere near me. And I know you kiss him so sincerely now. Even though the signal's indistinct. And you worry what silly people think. Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out. I bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millions. I suppose he'll never know about.
3188,Elvis Costello,Rock,Lightning Up!. And shake the ground. Is that a horn that's blowing?. Or a bell that's tolling?. Walls are falling. Ships pulled out from their mooring. Is that a river or just a road the storm has stolen?. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work. Lightning Up!. And fly the coop. Far from this tin-pan alley oop. Did you think I was your dupe?. I hear such lies and howlers. Words to pull out your molars. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work. Lightning Up!. Sugar the pill. A wall of ocean ten miles high. Metal darts torn from the sky. Like wanton boys make noise pull wings from flies. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work
3189,Elvis Costello,Rock,You turn to the sinister when you get the boot. Sliding down the banister in your Sunday suit. Lying on a slag heap of blankets and magazines. She's only thirty-five going on seventeen. You'd better roll over and go to sleep if you don't come clean. And in every home there will be lots of time. I will be all yours you might have been admired. (And in every home there will be lots of time). They say they're very sorry but you are not desired. Oh heaven preserve us. Oh heaven preserve us. Oh heaven preserve us. Because they don't deserve us. Holding your life in your hand. With an artificial limp wrist. And so a young blade becomes a has-been. Looking for a new twist. A year after the wedding he broke all their china plates. He's in prison now she's running with his mates. Sees him every Sunday. And he asks her where she's been. She's only thirty-five going on seventeen. She's going to cop a packet if he ever finds her. In between the sheets. (chorus). .
3190,Elvis Costello,Rock,15 Petals. One for every year I spent with you. Jewels and precious metals will never do. I love you twisted. And I love you straight. I'd write it down but I can't concentrate. Words won't me obey they do as they please. And all I am left with is these.... 15 Petals. One for every year I spent with you. Jewels and precious metals will never do. The thorn is blunted. And The perfume will fade. I stand where sun is set. I crave the shade. Down in the tavern with Mary and Joe. Palms reached for alms as they throw. 15 Petals.... One for every hour that we're apart. Tears and useless battles. I'll never start. Mussolini highway. There's a frankincense tree. I picked some up there to carry with me. You take me to places where I never go. I love you more than you know. 15 Petals. Scattered in the path where you will tread. 15 Petals. Of vivid red. One wine-bar vamp with the polythene. Ein Panzer Kommander with no hair in place.
3191,Elvis Costello,Rock,Five gears in reverse. For girls looking at the big lift. Somebody send out for the night nurse. Please don't stick me on the late shift. If you don't know by now. Nobody's gonna tell you. If you don't know by now. The shock will probably kill you. But if your patience is corrupted and you still cannot decide. You're sitting in the garage contemplating suicide. And you have no motivation you can't even catch your breath. All of this acceleration is driving you to death. Five gears in reverse. You think I don't know what I'm doing. Another fashionable first. Like walking down the road to ruin. But if you're safe and sound. Don't let me interrupt you. And if you're gagged and bound. Well how can I corrupt you.
3192,Elvis Costello,Rock,The glitter on a paint and plaster face. Is covering desire and disgrace. We could be lovers. But no one suspects at all. Once you're inside that costume ball. And now I'm sitting here before the mirror. I have the skill still to disguise my tears. Then as the magic starts to fade. I find myself abandoning the masquerade. Even though you're suffering. You try to hide it. And pretend you're so nonchalant. You can cry a pool of tears. And sit beside it. Then perhaps you'll know what you want. I hope you never feel this much despair. Or know the meaning of that empty chair. As the illusions that we made all fade away. In this abandoned masquerade
3193,Elvis Costello,Rock,Almost blue. Almost doing things we used to do. There's a girl here and she's almost you. Almost all the things that you eyes once promised.
3194,Elvis Costello,Rock,Bama Lama Bama Loo. Gotta girl named Lucinda. They call her the great pretender. Gotta girl named Lucinda. They call her the great pretender. And when she talks. She says a Bama Lama Loo. Chorus. Bama Lama Bama Loo. Bama Lama Bama Loo. Bama Lama Bama Loo. Bama Lama Bama Loo. Well I dig her style. She's bout to drive me wild. With Bama Lama Bama Loo. Well I asked my little baby for a kiss. She shook her head around like this. Well I asked my little girl for a kiss. She shook her head around like this. She said ..... (Chorus).
3195,Elvis Costello,Rock,Lucy Grace can't show her face down in the North End Road. For in Belgravia. Rumours have been whispered and suggestions have been made. Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense?. You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense. You say you need the money. When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance. Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms. Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?. Only fingertips from forbidden bliss. Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?. Who's that sneaking 'round the door?. You can't come here no more. Can't you go home again?. She used to sit alone for hours. Spend her evenings watering dried flowers. When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed. Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head. She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead. Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat. It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that. She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes. Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom. And her ugly sister's tranquillizers. Why were you so tardy putting up your guard?. When you hurt so easily and you try so hard. Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms. Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?. Only fingertips from forbidden bliss. Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?
3196,Elvis Costello,Rock,You say that you can and then you run to get your mummy. And you're almost beaten to the punch. Looking for the man who sold you the dummy. And you're almost beaten to the punch. Laughing at the older guys who say it's just as well. Saved by the wedding bell. Almost beaten to the punch. You're looking for somebody new that you can knock around. You are almost beaten to the punch. If you've got a head for figures then you'd better count me out. You were almost beaten to the punch. You pulled the piece but you soon called it love. You go hand in glove. Almost beaten to the punch. Your body speaks much louder than your voice. You let it do the talking so I don't have any choice. Now you find the younger guys are putting up resistance. And you're almost beaten to the punch. You better get out now because you'll never go the distance. And you're almost beaten to the punch. You'll find a girl and you'll promise her anything. Even a wedding ring. Almost beaten to the punch. .
3197,Elvis Costello,Rock,History repeats the old conceits. The glib replies the same defeats. Keep your finger on important issues. With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues. I'm just the oily slick. On the windup world of the nervous tick. In a very fashionable hovel. I hang around dying to be tortured. You'll never be alone in the bone orchard. This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel. So in this almost empty gin palace. Through a two-way looking glass. You see your Alice. You know she has no sins. For all your jealousy. In a sense she still smiles very sweetly. Charged with insults and flattery. Her body moves with malice. Do you have to be so cruel to be callous. And now you find you fit this identikit completely. You say you have no secrets. And then leave discreetly. I might make it California's fault. Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault. Just like the canals of Mars and the great barrier reef. I come to you beyond belief. My hands were clammy and cunning. She's been suitably stunning. But I know there's not a hope in Hades. All the laddies cat call and wolf whistle. So-called gentlemen and ladies. Dog fight like rose and thistle. I've got a feeling. I'm going to get a lot of grief. Once this seemed so appealing. Now I am beyond belief.
3198,Elvis Costello,Rock,I was looking at the black and white world. It seemed so exciting. If you'd only put me back to back with that girl. When the night's inviting. With just a little lighting. There'll never be days like that again. When I was just a boy and men were men. You never go from moment to moment. You're the living double of a single fiction. You're very colourful with your compliments. As you feel the finger's friction. It's a freeze-frame. Still it's real life. You don't want to look. Cause you've seen the film and you've read the book. I was looking at the black and white world. Trying to name some pin-up. Those days she was just a beautiful girl. Now she's framed and hung up. I thought she was young. Up until I saw her last night in close detail. Though they all fade away when you're so pale. It's more than just a physical attraction. It starts with a face and ends up a fixation. But you're never gonna feel a fraction. Of the way it used to work on your imagination. When you were looking at the black and white world.... .
3199,Elvis Costello,Rock,Vain boys are gonna have to swallow their pride this time. So let the punishment fit the crime. It's under the table. Under your skin. Into the cable. Is this the death of the glory you're in?. Chorus:. Black sails in the sunset. White noise going yakety-yak. All the money in the world will never bring your body back. Is it some mysterious dance nobody can do?. Thought I knew all the steps quite clearly. I don't have a clue. Oooh. You're Cinderella with a ball and chain. And the shoe seems to fit you. You tell the truth sometimes but. You wouldn't know it if it hit you. Is this some new trick. Wired up in your head?. Do you make me sick. Or was I just force fed?.
3200,Elvis Costello,Rock,I feel like a boy with a problem. I can't believe what we've forgotten. And I even slapped your face and made you cry. It's the last thing I want to do. Pull the curtains on me and you. Pull the carpet from under love. Pull out like young lovers do. You swore you wouldn't shout. If it's not your punch then its your pout. Days in silence try my temper. Nights spent drinking to remember. How memories are always tender. I crept out last night behind your back. The little they know might be the pieces I lack. Came home drunk. Talking in circles. The spirit is willing but I don't believe in miracles. I've got a problem but let's go to bed. I can roll over and I can play dead. But here I am in the doghouse instead. I feel like a boy with a problem. I can't believe all you've forgotten. Sleeping with forgiveness in your heart for me.

3203,Elvis Costello,Rock,Men made out of monkeys. Men made into mice. Happy days are here again. And all the drinks half price. A girl with a trick and a man with a calling. Trying to make a living out of your downfalling. TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING out of anything at all. Didn't they teach you anything except how to be cruel. In that charm school. You and I as lovers. Were nothing but a farce. TRYING TO MAKE A SILK PURSE. OUT OF A SOW'S ARSE. Saying 'Why don't you watch me'. Hardly speaking SOTTO VOCE. I've got a notion. I've got an angle. Take your dreams and promises. And put them through the mangle. They say it's hell to finance too. And I just want to romance you. In this perpetual nightclub. I'll be yours eternal. Though the hours are long. And the noise infernal. JUST ONE SHAMEFUL ACT OR SOMETIMES TWO. WE MAKE BELIEVE WE'RE MAKING DO.
3204,Elvis Costello,Rock,She'll fix you with an iron cross. And cover you up with petals. And hang you up with some amber beads. And four or five precious metals. And in that black flamingo chair. You'll sit among her trophies. And pray to be abandoned. Till you don't know what hope is. CHORUS:. But there's one thing that I had to keep inside. Because I was shaking. Why don't you get some pride. There was a clown strike. And the clowns threw down their tools. But you don't have to play so hard. And I'm nobody's fool. You don't have to go so far. 'Cause I love you as you are. The big top is deserted now. And the circus girl rehearses. She knows how to turn their heads. And not fall between two horses. But all that seems a simple step. If only I were able. To love you like I want to do. And not by some times table. CHORUS. And it's pandemonium. For the humble and the mighty. You don't have to tumble for me. Even a clown knows when to strike. Tell me what you want of me. Or are you terrified of failure?. You put on a superstitious face. Behind all this paraphernalia. We're not living in a masquerade. Where you only have three wishes. It isn't easy to see. In a lifetime of mistaken kisses. CHORUS. In this pandemonium. For the humble and the mighty. You don't have to tumble for me.
3205,Elvis Costello,Rock,Tears on your blackmail. Written to ransom. A point of the fingernail. Says that he's handsome. Clowntime is over. Time to take cover. While others just talk and talk. Somebody's watching where the others don't walk. Clowntime is over. A voice in the shadows. Says that his men know. He don't step back as expected. He's otherwise and unprotected. Chorus. Almost too good to be true. Who do you? why do you? what do you do?. While everybody's hiding under covers. Who's making lover's lane safe again for lovers?. Chorus. .
3206,Elvis Costello,Rock,Clowntime Is Over. . Tears on your blackmail. Written to ransom. A point of the fingernail. Says that he's handsome. Clowntime is over. Time to take cover. While others just talk and talk. Somebody's watching where the others don't walk. Clowntime is over. A voice in the shadows. Says that his men know. He don't step back as expected. He's otherwise and unprotected. Chorus. Almost too good to be true. Who do you? why do you? what do you do?. While everybody's hiding under covers. Who's making lover's lane safe again for lovers?. Chorus. .
3207,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""Well you know your time has come. And you're sorry for what you've done. You should've never have been playing with a gun. In those Complicated Shadows. Well there's a line that you must toe. and it'll soon be time to go. but it's darker than you know in those Complicated Shadows. All you gangsters and rude clowns. Who were shooting up the town. When you should have found someone to put the blame on. Though the fury's hot and hard. I still see that cold graveyard. There's a solitary stone that's got your name on. You don't have to take it from me. But I know what I spake. You think you're like iron and steel. But iron and steel will bend and break. In those Complicated Shadows. Go!. Sometimes justice you will find. Is just dumb not colour-blind. And your poor shattered mind can't take it all in. All those phantoms and those shades. Should Jump up on Judgement Day. And say to the Almighty """"I'm still stinking of sin"""". But the jury was dismissed. Took his neck and they give it a twist. So you see you won't be missed in those Complicated Shadows. You can say just what you like in a voice like a John Ford film. Take the law into your hands. You will soon get tired of killing. In those Complicated Shadows. Complicated Shadows. Complicated Shadows. Complicated Shadows"""
3208,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""I saw a girl who'd found her consolation. She said """"One day my Prince of Peace will come"""". Above her head a portrait of her father. The wilted favour that he gave her still fastened to the frame. """"They've got his bones and everything he owns. I've got his name"""". Well you can laugh at this sentimental story. But in time you'll have to make amends. The sudden chill where lovers doubt their immortality. As the clouds cover the sky the evening ends. Describing a picture of eyes finally closing. As you sometimes glimpse terrible faces in the fire. We'll I'm the lucky goon. Who composed this tune. from birds arranged on the high wire. Who on earth is tapping at the window?. Does that face still linger at the pane?. I saw you shiver though the room was like a furnace. A shadow of regret across a young mother's face. So toll the bell or rock the cradle. Please don't let me fear anything I cannot explain."""
3209,Elvis Costello,Rock,The tiny slip at midnight. A little sip at noon. You're tired and torn approaching dawn. My penitent buffoon. Wouldn't you think I'd know by now. I shouldn't have entertained it. Couldn't you keep that to yourself. You cried for my forgiveness. You say it sets you free. You summon dear the shameful tears. That spill all over me. Wouldn't you think I'd know by now. I shouldn't have entertained it. Couldn't you keep that to yourself. The penny rides at evening tide. The vain requests. The blush of the night. And the blooming bush. Where you failed every test. What should I believe of you?. What should I forget. Am I innocent yet. Is it the wife you would have beaten. Is it the child you couldn't bear?. I fear you have mistaken me. For somebody who cares. The sophisticated victim. That you skilfully request. You can hide behind your wishes. You can hide behind despair. And all the wretched syndroms. That carry away the blame. Couldn't you keep you keep that to yourself. And wouldn't you shouldn't you couldn't you. Keep that to yourself
3210,Elvis Costello,Rock,Thank you for the days. Those endless days those sacred days you gave me. I'm thinking of the days. I won't forget a single day believe me. I bless the light. I bless the light that shines on you believe me. And though you're gone. You're with me every single day believe me. Days I remember all my life. Days where you can't see wrong from right. You took my life. And then I knew that very soon you'd leave me. But it's alright. Now I'm not frightened of this world believe me. I wish today could be tomorrow. The night is dark. It just brings sorrow let it wait. Thank you for the days. Those endless days those sacred days you gave me. I'm thinking of the days. I won't forget a single day believe me. I bless the light. I bless the light that shines on you believe me. And though you're gone. You're with me every single day believe me. Days I remember all my life. Days where you can't see wrong from right. You took my life. And then I knew that very soon you'd leave me. But it's alright. Now I'm not frightened of this world believe me...days. Thank you for the days. Those endless days those sacred days you gave me. I'm thinking of the days. I won't forget a single day believe me. I bless the light. I bless the light that shines on you believe me. And though you're gone.
3211,Elvis Costello,Rock,Deep dead blue. Deep dead blue. Deep dead blue that nightly shades. I'm lost in deep dead blue. Deep dead blue.
3212,Elvis Costello,Rock,Please put your rings on a diff'rent finger if you meet me tonight. 'Cause I can't stand those suspicious glances. 'Cause I know the things they're saying are right. They're saying why don't you straighten up. And see what you've got to lose. Put it all down to fate but you still got the chance to choose. I don't want to hear your whole life story. Or about my strange resemblance to some old flame. All I want is one night of glory. I don't even know your second name. Please put your rings on a diff'rent finger 'cause we've got so much at stake. I can't stand those suspicious glances. 'Cause they seem to cover ev'ry move I make. But if I can be alone with you completely tonight. Put your rings on a diff'rent finger. Before I turn out the light
3213,Elvis Costello,Rock,I can't believe the things I've seen. I wonder bout some things I've heard. Everybody's crying mercy. When they don't know the meaning of the word. A bad enough situation. Is sure enough getting worse. Everybody's crying justice. Just as long as there's business first. Toe to toe. Touch and go. Give a cheer. Get your souvenier. People running round in circles. Don't know what they're headed for. Everybody's crying peace on Earth. Just as soon as we win this war. Straight ahead. Knock em dead. Pack your kid. Choose your hypocrite. Well you don't have to go to off broadway. To see something played absurd. Everybody's crying mercy. When they don't know the meaning of the word. Nobody knows the meaning of the word. When they don't know the meaning of the word. Nobody knows the meaning of the word.
3214,Elvis Costello,Rock,I remember that dance. On the roof of my car. When St. Lucy's mad torch. Took away our best bar. Say we drank. And we prayed. Some just sat like a choir. Came the smoke. In the night. Came the heat. Came the fire. Ember glow lagered ash. I was pissed as a fart. Stricken some dumb plum numb. We was broken at heart. Say we drank. And we prayed. Some just sat like a choir. Came the smoke. In the night. Came the light. Came the fire
3215,Elvis Costello,Rock,That all could gather. That we could marry. Still. Faces absent. That she could see this. As if time hovered. That he'd caress him. That jars and lads and Carol Ann were. Shouts from brilliant corners. Word 'n tears confused. Sparks long sky bound. Long sky bound. Had I been wiser. And not so bleedin'. Still geezer poet. Wine cross the lips flow. Love through eyes goes. That he'd embrace him. That jars and lads and Carol Ann were. That all could gather. That we could marry. Still. Faces absent. That she could see this. As if time hovered. That he'd caress him. That jars and lads and Carol Ann were. Set by the bar so tender
3216,Elvis Costello,Rock,Now you've heard our refrain. And this story must end. 'Cause the stars can't stay up. They can only descend. Say we drank. And we prayed. Some just sit like a choir. Came the smoke. In the night. Came the heat. Came the fire. Timber tender. Tender will you remember. Grim sender I can't pretend. So I'll Surrender. Will you remember
3217,Elvis Costello,Rock,Oh it's not easy to resist temptation. Walking around looking like a figment of somebody else's imagination. Taking ev'ry word she says just like an open invitation. But the power of persuasion is no match for anticipation. Chorus:. Like a finger running down a seam. From a whisper to a scream. So I whisper and I scream. But don't get me wrong. Please don't leave me waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Hey. Oh oh oh oh oh. Oh if the customers like it then they'll keep on paying. If they keep on drinking then they'll end up staying. I heard someone say where have we met before. But the one over the eight seem less like one or more like four. Chorus.
3218,Elvis Costello,Rock,Enter Madam X painted in a shocking pink spangled dress. Her teeth are perfect but her mouth is loose. Rubbing their hands together she persuades them that it's better to confess. Which unpleasant fate they'd like to choose. (chorus). Every step might be your last. Money signs are in your eyes sucker. You've been taken in this time. You might just get out alive if you're lucky. All the vultures tuning in to Glitter Gulch. Are looking in on you. And they're hungry. he stood five feet tall in his elevator shoes and stovepipe hat. He was known by several different names. Prompted by Madam X he answered all their questions. And then after that he said I'm sick and tired of stupid games. (chorus). We've got prizes if you can afford. Some small humiliation before you get your reward. And I'd rather be an outlaw than an inlaw to you. And to live my life in miserable poverty. Than to have to grovel to have some dream home hovel. So watch me while I get away with prime time robbery. As he enters Madam X he things of red raged faces and the sweet greenbacks. He climbed upon his honey and he covered her with money. As they do their victory dance. He thinks I hope they choke upon their laughter tracks. They can all go straight to hell while we howl down the whole hotel.
3219,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""Her lips are sweet. Her legs are big. Her looks can make you. Dance the jig. Her touch is so soft. Her heart is so warm. What knocks me out. Is your hidden charms. Her voice is so soft. Her love is so true. I think about her. That's all I do. She's weak and wanton. In my arms. What moves me darling. Is your hidden charms. When I hold you. In my arms. Brings out all of your. Hidden Charms. Her kiss is so pure. As the morning dew. A real gone love. Is exciting too. Her eyes that talk. They say """"c'mon"""". What kills me baby. Is your hidden charms. When I hold you. In my arms. Brings out all of your. Hidden Charms."""
3220,Elvis Costello,Rock,Some things you never get used to. Even though you're feeling like another man. There's nothing that he can do for you. To shut me away as you walk through. Lovers laughing in their amateur hour. Holding hands in the corridors of power. Even though I'm with somebody else right now. High fidelity. Can you hear me?. There's a new kind of dedication. Maybe you'll find it down the tunnel. Maybe I got above my station. Maybe you're only changing channel. Even though you're nowhere near me. And I know you kiss him so sincerely now. Even though the signal's indistinct. And you worry what silly people think. Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out. I bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millions. I suppose he'll never know about.
3221,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""Here comes Mr. Misery. He's tearing out his hair again. He's crying over her again. He's standing in the super-market shouting at the customers. Here comes Mr. Misery. He'll never be any good with a mouth full of gold and blood. He's contemplating murder again. He must be in love. Chorus: But you know she doesn't want you. But you can't seem to get it in your head. Oh and you can't sleep at night. And she haunts you when you go to bed. When you're tired of talking and you can't drink it down. So you hang around and drown instead. Home isn't where it used to be. Home is anywhere you hang your head. You hang your head. Home is anywhere. You hang your head. Home is anywhere. You hang your head. Home is anywhere you hang your head. Here comes Mr. Misery. Looking for a place for his mouth to shoot. Saying """"You'd look cute in your birthday suit"""". You tore him out and screwed him up. Like a bad page in a naughty picture book. They day ended as it began. As he was seconds older than the man he was this morning. And the world has wiped it's mouth since then. Or maybe it was yawning."""
3222,Elvis Costello,Rock,I hung up the phone tonight. Just as you said I love you. Once this would have been coincidence. Now these things start to bother me. You still close your eyes when I kiss you. And I close mine too. But we didn't open them again. Quite as wide as we should. This is where the home truth ends. This is where the home truth ends. Does your touch feel the same as it should do. Or is it someone quite similar. Who killed me with kindness last night. Now do I look at all familiar?. But none of these things seem to matter. Since we've grown apart. I'd put back the pieces of what's shattered. But I don't know where to start. This is where the home truth ends. This is where the home truth ends. This is where the home truth ends. And I feel like a clown. It's tearing me up. It's tearing me down. You say which are the lies that you tell me. Well where do I begin?. So I turn on the TV again. And the world comes crashing in. Is it my shirt or my toothpaste. That is whiter than white?. Is it the lies that I tell you. Or the lies that I might?. This is where the home truth ends. This is where the home truth ends. Chorus.
3223,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""I've been talking to the wall and it's been answering me. Oh darling how I miss you. I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness. I crave the silhouette of your kiss. With only the blue light of the TV on. Lip reading threats and false alarms. There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself. And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn. Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt. That it's you that I'm dreaming about. Do I have to draw you a diagram?. All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands. With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze. Checkmate in three moves in your heyday. But the girls don't listen to your line anymore. Now you're part of someone else. On the factory floor and you still say """"Wheres the action?"""". Now you manufacture happiness. And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction. (chorus). All you toy soldiers and scaremongers. Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder. In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before. Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly. You know I love you more than slightly. Although I've never said it like this before. (chorus)."""
3224,Elvis Costello,Rock,I'm the living result. I'm a man who's been hurt a little too much. and I've tasted the bitterness of my own tears. sadness is all my lonely heart can feel. I can't stand up for falling down. I can't stand up for falling down. simple though love is. still it confused me. why I'm not loved the way I should be. now I've lived with heartaches. and I've roomed with fear. I've dealt with despair. and I've wrestled with tears. I can't stand up for falling down. I can't stand up for falling down. the vow that we made. you broke it in two. but that don't stop me from loving you. I can't stand up for falling down. I can't stand up for falling down.
3225,Elvis Costello,Rock,I dreamed of my old lover last night. I wonder if I spoke out loud. And if by chance my lover overheard. He put my face back in the crowd. His eyes were clear and gentle then. He kissed the troubles from my brow. I long to fall to sleep again. And I wonder how he would look now. Would our kids grow sullen or grow strong?. Would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun?. I like the way it feels but then. I rarely dream of anyone. I the songs of shame and the tales of dread. Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead. And all the vines wind through their eyes. Oh but no one knows this passion now. Oh no one knows this passion now. So I keep this fancy to myself. I keep my lipstick twisted tight. I long to fall to sleep again. I dreamed of my old lover last night. I long to fall to sleep again. 'Cause I dreamed of my old lover last night
3226,Elvis Costello,Rock,I once held her. In my arms. She said she would always stay. But I was cruel. And I treated her like a fool. I threw it all away. Once I had mountains. In the palm of my hand. And rivers to drink through everyday. But I must have been mad. I never knew what I had. Until I threw it all away. Love is all there is. That makes the world go round. Love as only love. Can't be denied. Not matter what you think about it. Just won't be able to do without it. Take a tip from one who's tried. So when you find someone. Who gives you all of her love. Take it to your heart don't. Let is stray. Cause one thing for certain. You will surely be hurting. If you throw it all away. If you throw it all away.
3227,Elvis Costello,Rock,I've got no time for fairy stories. I'm not a little girl. So you can leave me all alone. And turn off the lights as well. If you were frightened. Then listen:. But I don't think you'd like it. Such a nice kid. Nobody's lookin' now. I throw my toys around. Somebody's bein' very bad. I wonder who it can be. Somebody's goin' to get in trouble. I know it isn't me. I'm just a little angel. But you don't know what I've done. When your back's turned. Nobody's lookin' now. I throw my toys around. Pick up those building blocks. Chop off the baby's locks. Swing dolly by the hair. Put down that teddy bear. Slam dunk that happy clown. I throw my toys around. I've got no time for bedtime stories. I'm not a little child. Everything makes me furious. And everything makes me wild. If you were frightened. Then whistle:. And they'll come runnin' to you. As you boo-hoo. Nobody's looking now. I throw my toys around. I throw my toys around. [repeat and fade].
3228,Elvis Costello,Rock,Why must I be so lonely?. When so many people pass me by. I've been waiting for oh so long now. And yet I'm unable to answer why. I can't be made to give up now. Can you find room for me. in your heart somehow?. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved. I guess I'm a victim of loneliness. But why should this be my destiny?. A foolish man for a lot of my life. Shouldn't there be someone. Someone for me?. I hope and I pray some happy day. That I'll be around to hear you say. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved. .
3229,Elvis Costello,Rock,I want to vanish. This is my fondest wish. To go where I cannot be captured. Laid on a decorated dish. Even in splendor this curious fate. Is more than I care to surrender. Now it's too late. Whether in wonder or indecent haste. You arrange the mirrors and the spools. To snare the rare and precious jewels. That were only made of paste. If you should stumble upon my last remark. I'm crying in the wilderness. I'm trying my best to make it dark. How can I tell you I'm rarer than most. I'm certain as a lost dog. Pondering a sign post. Chorus. I want to vanish. This is my last request. I've given you the awful truth. Now give me my rest.
3230,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell. I don't think I can live without you. And I know that I never will. Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death. I can't say anymore than """"I love you"""". Everything else is a waste of breath. I want you. You've had your fun you don't get well no more. I want you. Your fingernails go dragging down the wall. Be careful darling you might fall. I want you. I woke up and one of us was crying. I want you. You said """"Young man I do believe you're dying"""". I want you. If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days. I want you. You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways. I want you. Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget. I want you. Since when were you so generous and inarticulate. I want you. It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for. It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for. I want you. It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing. It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing. I want you. He tossed some tatty compliment your way. I want you. And you were fool enough to love it when he said. """"I want you"""". I want you. The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark. It scares you witless. But in time you see things clear and stark. I want you. Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop. I want you. I'm afraid I won't know where to stop. I want you. I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you. I want you. I want to know the things you did that we do too. I want you. I want to hear he pleases you more than I do. I want you. I might as well be useless for all it means to you. I want you. Did you call his name out as he held you down. I want you. Oh no my darling not with that clown. I want you. I want you. You've had your fun you don't get well no more. I want you. No-one who wants you could want you more. I want you. I want you. I want you. Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up. I want you. I'm going to say it once again 'til I instill it. I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it. I want you. I want you. I want you."""
3231,Elvis Costello,Rock,What do you get when you fall in love?. A girl with a pin to burst your bubble. That's what you get for all your trouble. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. What do you get when you kiss a girl?. You get enough germs to catch pneumonia. After you do she'll never phone you. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. Don't tell me what it's all about. 'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out. Out of those chains those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you. What do you get when you give your heart?. You get it all broken up and battered. That's what you get a heart that's shattered. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. Out of those chains those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you. What do you get when you fall in love?. You only get lies and pain and sorrow. So for at least until tomorrow. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again.
3232,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""I hate these flaming curtains they're not the color of your hair. I hate these striplights they're not so undoing as your stare. I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I wanna do is tear. I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here. [chorus]. Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down. And nail my feet up where my head should be. If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown. And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly. Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm. In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm. You have this expression dear no words could take its place. And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face. [chorus]. I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls. If you'll wear it proudly through the snakepits and catcalls. Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss. If you don't know what is wrong with me. Then you don't know what you've missed. We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight. When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright. But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess. And a handful of eagerness says """"What do you suggest?""""."""
3233,Elvis Costello,Rock,Hail to the taxis. They go where I go. Farewell the newspapers that know more than I know. Flung under a street-lamp still burning at dawn. I'm in the mood again. I walk the damp streets rather than slumber. Along the fine windows of shameless and plunder. But none of their riches could ever compare. I'm in the mood again. I don't know what's come over me. But it's nothing that I'm doing wrong. You took the breath right out of me. Now you'll find it in the early hours. In a lover's song. I lay my head down on fine linens and satin. Away from the mad-hatters who live in Manhattan. The Empire State Building illuminating the sky.
3234,Elvis Costello,Rock,We play these parlour games. We play at make believe. When we get to the part where I say that I'm going to leave. Everybody loves a happy ending but we don't even try. We go straight past pretending. To the part where everybody loves to cry. (chorus). Indoor fireworks. Can still burn your fingers. Indoor fireworks. We swore we were safe as houses. They're not so spectacular. They don't burn up in the sky. But they can dazzle or delight. Or bring a tear. When the smoke gets in your eyes. You were the spice of life. The gin in my vermouth. And though the sparks would fly. I thought our love was fireproof. Sometimes we'd fight in public darling. With very little cause. But different kinds of sparks would fly. When we got on our own behind closed doors. (chorus). It's time to tell the truth. These things have to be faced. My fuse is burning out. And all that powder's gone to waste. Don't think for a moment dear that we'll ever be through. I'll build a bonfire of my dreams. And burn a broken effigy of me and you.
3235,Elvis Costello,Rock,(instrumental)
3236,Elvis Costello,Rock,The children sit upon the stairs. High above a valley of tears. Don't let them see you crying that way oh no. Oh no Joe Porterhouse. Is not gone forever. He'll be back another day. Don't let them see you crying that way. Chorus. Please don't wake him let him sleep. It's a moment she can keep. Like an old bus ticket or a photograph. Resting on the mantlepiece. While for the wicked there is no peace. She says it's not his time to go. Why we were nearly lovers years ago. Now what is left for me. Among the broken branches of the family tree. Heart like an anchor. Arms like cable. He stood all alone on an iron turntable. Don't let them see you crying that way oh no. The sun beats down. It's cracking the flags. Boys who should know better. Are stamping out fags. Don't let them see you laughing that way. Chorus. Oh no Joe Porterhouse. Is not gone forever. He'll be back another day. Don't let them see you crying that way.
3237,Elvis Costello,Rock,He saw no tears in her eyes. Say you wouldn't kid about it. She's telling all of those lies. She swore she'd never told before. But I doubt it. So he bit his tongue. And tried hard to capture his breath. When she said I waited all my life. For just a little death. Say you wouldn't kid about it. Say you wouldn't kid about it. Say you wouldn't kid about it. Sometimes he takes himself so seriously. She makes her movements mysteriously. Slow fast or furiously. It's a big responsibility. With a face full of mixed ability. Big dreams of elegance. Singing the leaving of Liverpool. And turning into Americans. Say you wouldn't kid about it. So what if this is a man's world. I want to be a kid again about it. Give me back my sadness. I couldn't hide it even if I tried girl. We fight so frail. Making love tooth and nail. You gave me the kiss of my life. I might even live to tell the tale. (chorus).
3238,Elvis Costello,Rock,Hear what I say. See what I do. Believe me now I'm all over you. All over you. I know a place. A CERTAIN VERY TENDER SPOT. TO HAVE AND TO HOLD. TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. Listening to the sad song that the radio plays. Have we come this fa-fa-fa to find a soul cliche. Let them talk. Let them talk. Let them all talk. Oh yeah we're killing time. Just to KEEP YOU CLOCKING ON. These are the best years of your life. Now they're here and gone. Do the world a service. And you could do yourself a favour. WHOSE TONGUE NOW IS TASTING LAST WEEK'S FLAVOUR. Our day will come. When you have squandered all your youth. To have and to hold. A stranger to the truth. Listening to the sad song that the radio plays. Have we come this fa-fa-fa to find a soul cliche. Let them talk.
3239,Elvis Costello,Rock,Shall I wear a buttonhole to jog your memory?. So you'll recall the promise. That I swore you made to me when we were younger. You look sorry for yourself but what about?. I'm some idea you're not without a doubt. So you can put away that tongue. I don't know who I'm trying to kid. I'll find another name for you. I'll try to put the blame on you. For everything we did. Life shrinks and before you know it. You have forgotten all the cuts and bruises. Just be thankful we were only fighting for buttons. And you know by now who loses. You're only half awake because you never go to bed. And when he hears about it. You know then the both of you's is dead and that's a promise. You'll be sorry because I won't tell you again. You'll stick like that one day. And if you don't believe me go and ask St. Thomas. I don't know where it's going to stop. Spend your whole time trying to stay. From breaking down or running away. Or trying to keep up.
3240,Elvis Costello,Rock,You left the motor running.. But I know you're so attractive.. Getting in some sharp practice.. You better not do anything reckless.. But everybody is going through the motions.. Everybody is going through the motions.. Are you really only going through the motions?. Lip service is all you'll ever get from me.. Lip service is all you'll ever get from me.. Lip service is all you'll ever get from me.. But if you change your mind. you can send it a letter to me. Don't make any sudden movements.. These are dangerous amusements.. When did you become so choosy?. Don't act like you're above me;. just look at your shoes.. [Repeat bridge and chorus]. But if you change your mind. you can send it a letter to me. But if you change your mind. you can send it a letter to me. But if you change your mind.
3241,Elvis Costello,Rock,Don't say you love me when it's just a rumour. Don't say a word if there is any doubt.. Sometimes I think that love is just a tumour;. you've got to cut it out.. You say you're sorry for the things that you've done.. You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it.. I wouldn't worry. I had so much fun.. Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being. It's you. not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue. It's you. not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue. oh yeah.. Get to the slot machine almost dead on arrival. Just hit me one more time with that live wire. Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million. You say I've got not feelings;. this is a good way to kill them.. Select the control and then insert the token. You wanna throw me away but I'm not broken.. You've got a lot to say. Well I'm not joking.. There are some words they don't allow to be spoken.. Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being. It's you. not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue.
3242,Elvis Costello,Rock,I would have waited all my life. Just to make love out of something other than spite. But the beauty is the beast you're baiting. Should really be worth the waiting. You do something very special to. Mr. Average. Now the lamb lies with the lion. He's just a little savage. And so you turn your back on me. And all the hot air that only echoes stale tobacco. Actions speak louder now than words. By just a fraction. What's the use of saying I love you whe I'm drinking to distraction. We save our sanity. By saying such and such. After all its been discussed. You say you must be touched. (chorus).
3243,Elvis Costello,Rock,(chorus). It's going round the town. It's going round the town. It's going round the town. You're so lovable. My baby gave me notice to quit. I just can't get used to it. She broke my little heart in two. Now somebody else is being the same old you. (chorus). My baby has Egyptian eyes. And a wicked look beyond compare. If you thought I was a fool for you. Then I must be a bigger fool for her. (chorus). He'd turn the flowers of springtime into a wreath. He says he'd love you eternally. I say please please can't you keep it brief. They say they're going to bury you. Because you're so lovable. Put your money where your mouth was. You're so lovable. Each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam. You're so lovable. The toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom. You're so lovable. You're so sweet. You're so honest. You say `I'll be true to you boy'. But I won't promise. Then you say you love me. Then you show me. As you lie there so lifelike below me.
3244,Elvis Costello,Rock,You lie so unfolded. In a love field. With your contempt for any modesty. In a love field. In a love field. In a love field. You yield with your lips still sealed. In a love field. Lost in a sea of imaginary women. Everything you'd want. from the dawn to the dimming. Breath comes sharp and heart beats faster. In a love field. Cold ground for a pillow. Under a blanket of stars. In a love field. In a love field. In a love field. Headlights that startled. This embrace of hours. In a love field. In a crooked house. Where things can be arranged. You think you're different from the rest. But you don't see how you've changed. Under an archway. On a road of white linen. In a love field. Feel the anxious rhythm of a functional stranger. In a love field. In a love field. In a love field. She's so tense but it's never mentioned. In a love field.
3245,Elvis Costello,Rock,I've looked at it every way I can. From under and above. And every chance I've had. My love went mad. Love went mad love went mad. You you feel like I feel?. Do you have a heart?. DO YOU HAVE A HEART OF IRON AND STEEL?. Are you a man now you wear a man's hat?. Are you a man now or are you a rat?. You go to church quiet as a mouse. You're a big cheese now in the workhouse. With these vulgar fractions of the treble clef. I wish you luck with a capital 'F'. A self-made mug is hard to break. A silent partner in someone else's mistake. Every day goes by without a hitch. YOU FEEL THE URGE BECOMING AN ITCH. The boys in blue are hard to catch. They're busy turning Piccadilly. Into Brands Hatch. But with your fingers in your ears. Feeling bright as a button. Thinking 'THANK GOD THERE'LL BE NO MORE. LAMB DRESSED AS MUTTON'. Playing family favourites on a tissue and a comb. DYING A THOUSAND DEATHS. IN THE SAFETY OF YOUR OWN HOME.
3246,Elvis Costello,Rock,So this is where he came to hide. When he ran from you. In a private detective's overcoat. And dirty dead man's shoes. The pretty things of Knightsbridge. Lying for a minister of state. Is a far cry from the nod and wink. Here at traitor's gate. 'Cause the high heel he used to be has been ground down. And he listens for the footsteps that would follow him around. To murder my love is a crime. But will you still love. A man out of time. There's a tuppeny hapenny millionaire. Looking for a fourpenny one. With a tight grip on the short hairs. Of the public imagination. But for his private wife and kids somehow. Real life becomes a rumour. Days of dutch courage. Just three French letters and a German sense of humour. He's got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge. He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege. (chorus). The biggest wheels of industry. Retire sharp and short. And the after dinner overtures. Are nothing but an after thought. Somebody's creeping in the kitchen. There's a reputation to be made. Whose nerves are always on a knife's edge. Who's up late polishing the blade. Love is always scarpering or cowering or fawning. You drink yourself insensitive and hate yourself in the morning.
3247,Elvis Costello,Rock,Moods for moderns (x4). I get hit looking for a miss. I never thought that it would come to this. Moods for moderns (x4). Though we may never be the same again. I am so proud that you've been taken in vain. What if none of your dreams come true?. I can never run from you. There's never been a how d'you do. There's never been an ending. Soon you'll belong to someone else. And I will be your stranger just pretending. Moods for moderns. Memory lingers. I let you into. Foreign fingers. Moods for moderns (x4). I never thought that would see the day. I never thought that I would give you away. (Chorus). Moods for moderns. Let them break us. Strong and sudden. Foreign fingers.
3248,Elvis Costello,Rock,This town belongs to you and your tricks of confidence. All the pavements for miles around are littered with your footprints. Now every girl I get close to seems to be wearing your perfume. And the clock strikes the letters of your name. Both midnight and noon. But I used to shoot my mouth off. Till you'd had enough of me. Once or twice nightly. I know I've got my faults. And among them I CAN'T CONTROL MY TONGUE. But if you didn't believe me. Why did you have to leave me. With my mouth almighty. Mouth almighty that's what I've got. Mouth almighty telling you what's what. Mouth almighty. I wish I'd never opened my mouth almighty. SO I THREW AWAY THE ROSE AND HELD ONTO THE THORN. Crawling round with my crooner cufflinks and my calling card cologne. But the realization of being replaced starts to tell tales across my face. Without a soul to talk to or a hair out of place. .
3249,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""She was smitten from the first. By a curious fellow. She said I love the way you talk. And with a flounce she then announces. I love the way that you pronounce it: """"Marshmallow"""". So she liked to sing along. To her favourite song. From the year that she was born. She had mysterious affairs (?) (not sure this line is right). Until she woke up in the '80's. CHORUS:. So speak to me. Just like you should. And then you can say those wicked things. And if you want. We'll make it good. Before my mood swings. Well he looked like one of those. Who would take off his clothes. Like he would peel a tangerine. No-one's been known to decline this. Until I've found out what your sign is."""
3250,Elvis Costello,Rock,I might say that I don't care. Hold my head up in the air. Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call. But when the day is through. That's when my heartaches start anew. And that's when I miss you most of all. And my arms keep reaching for you. And my eyes keep searching for you. And my lips keep calling for you. And my shoes keep walking back to you. No matter how much I pretend. I wish I had you back again. 'Cause nothin' means half as much as you. My world just seemed to die. The day you said goodbye. And I can't forget no matter what I do. And my arms keep reaching for you. And my eyes keep searching for you. And my lips keep calling for you. And my shoes keep walking back to you. . .
3251,Elvis Costello,Rock,Bad lovers face to face in the morning. Shy apologies and polite regrets. Slow dances that left no warning of. Outraged glances and indiscreet yawning. Good manners and bad breath get you nowhere. Even presidents have newspaper lovers. Ministers go crawling under covers. She's no angel. He's no saint. They're all covered up with white washed grease paint. And you say.... Chorus:. The teacher never told you anything but white lies. But you never see the lies. And you believe. Oh you know you have been captured. You feel so civilized. And you look so pretty in your new lace sleeves. The salty lips of the socialite sisters. With their continental fingers that have. never seen working blisters. Oh I know they've got their problems. I wish I was one of them. They say daddy's coming home soon. With his sergeant stripes and his Empire mug and spoon. No more fast buck. And when are they gonna learn their lesson. When are they gonna stop all of these victory processions. And you say.... Chorus.
3252,Elvis Costello,Rock,The East has that Englishmen. And the rising sun. The West has the open plains. And how they were won. On Independence Day. For all it's worth. You can ring those southern belles. I'm going. North. Up were the rushing rivers run and salmon leap. I could even get there in my sleep. Give me the ice and snow. Time to go.... North. So run up a banner and we'll stand underneath. You gave me a starry flag. For one with a leaf. I'm on the borderline. I jump back and forth. There's nothing to stop me now. I'm heading.... North. Up where the polar bears and moose and geese will play. And some of them address you en franÃ§ais. Give me the ice and snow. Time to go.... North. And so I must leave you all. Alas and alack. And though we are parting now. I'll always come back. So as the compass points. That's where I'll be. But if you could only see. The perfection of.... North. It's something I will always carry in my heart. A place when dreams begin and life can start. Who cares what people know?. Let me go....
3253,Elvis Costello,Rock,The ink is running. The words are taught. I'm sitting helpless with my paper and charts. I had to follow my passion. Oh well. I don't get paid that much for all I deserve. To waste a sentence or shatter my nerves. I had to follow my passion. Oh well. Sometimes I long to run outside. I'd give it all up but it's my pride. Oh well. Oh well. I had a dream once or so I thought. I'd be a pilot or an astronaut. I had a dream like that until I found. Even an astronaut goes into the ground. Life is just passing us bye-bye. Oh well. Oh well. Oh well
3254,Elvis Costello,Rock,Don't start that talking. I could talk all night. my mind was sleep walking. While I was putting the world to rights. Call careers information. Have you got yourself an occupation. Olivers Army is here to stay. Olivers army is on their way. And I would rather be anywhere else. But here today. There was a checkpoint charlie. He didn't crack a smile. But it's no laughing party. When you've been on the murder mile. All it takes is one itchy trigger. One more widow one less white nigger. Olivers Army is here to stay. Olivers army is on their way. And I would rather be anywhere else. But here today. Hong Kong is up for grabs. London is full of Arabs. We could be in Palestine. Overrun by a Chinese line. With the boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne. But there's no danger. It's a professional career. Though it could be arranged. With just a word in Mr. Churchill's ear. If you're out of luck or out of work. We could send you to Johannesburg. Olivers Army is here to stay. Olivers army is on their way. And I would rather be anywhere else. But here today.
3255,Elvis Costello,Rock,This is the place where I made my best mistakes. This is the place even angels don't understand. I've seen the disappointment in her face. And the collection of engagement rings on her right hand. She sits alone apart from the crowd. In a white dress she wears like a question mark. Friends speak of her fondly. Enemies just think out loud. You think you're man enough to please her. And you're fool enough to start. You're not going to do a thing to our little angel. There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change. Now the cabaret is frozen and the laughter comes in cans. And the lonely hearts club clientele don't know what to do with their hands. You think that you'll be sweet to her but everybody knows. That you're the marshmallow valentine that got stuck on her clothes. But you're not going to do a thing to our little angel. There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change. So you mix your drinks and words. You make bad jokes you make bad time. The floors are there to walk over. The walls are there to climb. You swear that you'll never go back again once you're inside. You're never the bridegroom she's always the bride. And you're not going to do a thing to our little angel. There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change. You'll come in a sweetheart and you'll go out a stranger. Well you try to love her but she's so contrary. Like a chainsaw running through a dictionary. So get your mind off the sweet behind of our little angel. You're not going to do a thing. You're not going to do a thing.
3256,Elvis Costello,Rock,They say you're nothing but a party girl. Just like a million more all over the world. I know I shouldn't be raising my hopes so high. But I have seen the hungry look in their eyes. They'd settle for anything in disguise of love. Seen the party girls look me over. Seen 'em leaving when the party's over. They can't touch me now. You say you don't mind. We're so hard to find. I could give you anything but time. Give it just one more try. Give it a chance. Starts like fascination. Ends up like a trance. Oh you'll never be the guilty party girl. Maybe someday we can go hiding from this world. Maybe I'll never get over the change in style. But I don't want to lock you up and say you're mine. Don't want to lose you or say goodbye. I'm the guilty party and I want my slice. But I know you've got me and I'm in a grip-like vise.. They can't touch me now. You say you don't mind. We're so hard to find. I could give you anything. I would give you anything. I can give you anything but time. Give you anything but time (repeats).
3257,Elvis Costello,Rock,Obscure the late afternoon with a drape. Don't let him follow her latest escape. Or the fanfare of taxis that needlessly played. As a forty watt bulb burns a hole in the shade. Then they got into a passionate fight. Now she's lost in the shadows thrown over at twilight. At the Empire Hotel they first came face to face. Pieces would fall off all over the place. And there in the debris they'd laugh and recline. Tell me my dear are you more or less mine. Then they got into a passionate fight. She says now this isn't love it's what you do in spite of it. And I can't go on with it night after night after night. Camphor and cigarettes perfume the scandal. Now he's counting the hinges and watching the door handle. As he hangs the clothes on the back of the door. Perfectly matching outfits that she wore. Women come quietly and some remain with their pity. But others know the pain of the passion of fight. Though the chance they will win is impossibly slight. He cowers before them so invitingly. And in the long run they'll be chastised and hated. Or walk out frustrated or humiliated. That is the pointless delight of a passionate fight. This isn't love what you do in spite of it. I can't go on night after night after night after night after night after night...
3258,Elvis Costello,Rock,The poisoned rose. That you gave to me. It left me half alive. And half in ecstasy. But if half of your love. Is all I can win. Give me just a fraction. But no more medicine. The poisoned rose. On a Valentine card. That you take straight to the heart. That you call my junkyard. But if all I can do. is save pieces of you. The piece of your mind. The piece of your heart. Didn't tear me apart. Like the poisoned rose. I received from you. I don't know. How we came to grow. Into this very sad affair. Everytime we do the decent thing. Somebody spikes the drink. And a single becomes a pair. The poisoned rose. That you wear at your best. That I keep pressed between the white sheets. Where you lie half undressed. I threw away my shirt and shoes. You looked and I dived in. It's just you and me now. 'Cause I threw away the gin. I threw away your alibis. And all your worn-out clothes. I threw myself upon the floor. But I couldn't throw away. This poisoned rose. This poisoned rose.
3259,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""He's out in the woods with his squirrel gun. To try to recapture his anger. He's screaming some words at the top of his lungs. Until he begins to feel younger. But back at his desk in the city we find. Our trembling punch-drunken fighter. Who can't find the strength now to punish the length. Of the ribbon in his little typewriter. Poor fractured Atlas. Threw himself across the mattress. Waving his withering pencil as if it were a pirate's cutlass. I'm almost certain he's trying to increase his burden. He said """"That's how the child in me planned it. A woman wouldn't understand it"""". I believe there was something that I wanted to say. Before I conclude this epistle. But you would forgive me for holding my tongue. 'Cause man made the blade and the pistol. Yes man made the waterfall and the dam. To temper his tantrum with magic. Now you can't be sure of that ten of azure. Since he punched a hole in the fabric. Poor fractured Atlas. Threw himself across the mattress. Waving his withering pencil as if it were a pirate's cutlass. I'm almost certain he's trying to increase his burden. He said """"That's how the child in me planned it. A woman wouldn't understand it""""."""
3260,Elvis Costello,Rock,I was tuning in the shine on the light night dial. doing anything my radio advised. with every one of those late night stations. playing songs bringing tears to me eyes. I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver. when the switch broke 'cause it's old. They're saying things that I can hardly believe.. They really think we're getting out of control.. Radio is a sound salvation. Radio is cleaning up the nation. They say you better listen to the voice of reason. But they don't give you any choice. 'cause they think that it's treason.. So you had better do as you are told.. You better listen to the radio.. I wanna bite the hand that feeds me.. I wanna bite that hand so badly.. I want to make them wish they'd never seen me.. . Some of my friends sit around every evening. and they worry about the times ahead. But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference. and the promise of an early bed. You either shut up or get cut out;. they don't wanna hear about it.. It's only inches on the reel-to-reel.. And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools. tryin' to anaesthetise the way that you feel. [Chorus]. Wonderful radio. Marvelous radio. Wonderful radio.
3261,Elvis Costello,Rock,It's hurting me. It's hurting me. This doubt is hurting me. So remove this doubt. From my heart little girl. And let me live my life. Knowing you care. Remove this doubt. From my mind little girl. And let me breathe again. Feeling my love is shared. Each time we meet. You make me feel so incomplete. There's no joy in the air. I just don't think you care. Close the door. On doubt forever. And may it nevermore. Make me unsure. Turn the key. And lock away this doubt in me. Keep it in the dark. Not in my heart. Be more tender. Completely surrender. Your love to me. Is sweet and not discrete. Remove this doubt. From my heart little girl. And let me live my life. Knowing you care. Remove this doubt. From my mind little girl. And let me breathe again. Knowing my love is shared. Each time we meet. You make me feel so incomplete. There's no joy in the air. I just don't think you care. Remove this doubt from my heart (6X).
3262,Elvis Costello,Rock,Forever doesn't mean forever anymore. I said forever. But it doesn't look like I'm gonna be around much anymore. When the heat gets sub-tropical. And the talk gets so topical. Riot act - you can read me the riot act. You can make me a matter of fact. Or a villain in a million. A slip of the tongue is gonna keep me civilian. Why do you talk such stupid nonsense. When my mind could rest much easier. Instead of all this dumb dumb insolence. I would be happier with amnesia. They say forget her. Now it looks like you're either gonna be for me or against me. I got your letter. Now they say I don't care for the colour that it paints me. Trying to be so bad is bad enough. Don't make me laugh by talking tough. Don't put your heart out on your sleeve. When your remarks are off the cuff.
3263,Elvis Costello,Rock,Picture a hotel room. Clothes scattered across the floor. Covers pulled back from the pillow. A sign hung on the door. Two lovers locked up tight. Through the endless days and nights. Hiding something they can't show. Something no-one must know. Chorus. There's a room without a number. While the sign outside says there's. no vacancy as you take your key. They smile at you so understandingly. She cried out in the night. Woke the porter from his sleep. He grinned slyly to himself. As he went to fetch his keys. Look what love has brought them to. This terrible nightmare. His or hers he could not tell. As they were sleeping there. Chorus. And I wish he could be. The man he was before he was me. A girl arrived at first light. And enquired if they'd been seen. And why the numbers ran from twelve. Missing out thirteen. And they said oh my darling. Put it down to superstition. Try to avoid a scandal. And don't arouse suspicion. They re-arranged the furniture. They even papered over the door. There's a room without a number. While the sign outside says there's. no vacancy as you take your key. They smile just so so you know. Chorus. .
3264,Elvis Costello,Rock,Sure you haven't got the wrong number. Sure it's me you want to talk to tonight. Everyone in town's got your number. Everyone in town's got you pegged just right. Is that why you got in touch with me. I guess you must be running out of fools. Even when you left me there crying. Your goodbye was even colder than ice. You didn't care that you left me there crying. Now you wanna break my heart twice. Is that why you got in touch with me. I guess you must be running out of fools. I guess you got back to my name in your little black book. Hey guess what I bet you forgot how I even look. So go ahead with all your sweet talking. Go ahead for all the good it will do. Have yourself a dime's worth of talking. Then I'm gonna hang right up on you. Cause this time you're not getting through to me. I guess you must be running out of fools. Even fools like me. Even fools like me. I guess you're running out of fools.
3265,Elvis Costello,Rock,This must be the place. Second place in the human race. Down in the basement. Now I know what he meant. Secondary modern. But there must be a problem till the girls go home. This is the hand that you never shook. You never gave me the chance that I took. Secondary modern. But there won't be a problem till the girls go home. Is it out of the question. Between you and me. Is it pleasure or business. Or a packet of three?. Nobody makes me sad like you. Now my whole world goes from blue to blue. Secondary modern. But there won't be a problem till the girls go home....
3266,Elvis Costello,Rock,Chorus:. Senior service. Junior dissatisfaction. It's a breath you took too late. It's a death that's worse than fate. Senior service. Junior dissatisfaction. Though it may be second hand. It's by no means second rate. I want your neck. I want the seat that you sit at. I want your cheque. Because they told me I would get on. I wanna chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket. If you should drop dead tonight then they won't have to ask me twice. (Chorus). They took me in the office and they told me very carefully. The way that I could benefit from death and disability. (Chorus). I want your company car. I want your girlfriend and love. I want your place at the bar. Because there's always another man. To chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket. If you should drop dead tonight then they won't have to ask me twice.
3267,Elvis Costello,Rock,Giving you more of what for. Always worked for me before. Now I'm a shabby doll. What's going on behind the green elevator door. With just a shabby doll. There's a hit man facing. A compromising situation. With just a shabby doll. And a very neat line in character assassination. She's just a shabby doll. She's just a shabby doll. She's putting him off and putting you on. She's just the shabby doll. You're swearing upon you know in your heart. She's gone you know in your heart. She's just a shabby doll. There's a girl in this dress. There's always a girl in distress. She's just a shabby doll. She's so sure she's self-possessed. Then again she's half undressed. She's just a shabby doll. The boy that I used to be. Showed no sign of sympathy. For just a shabby doll. I have betrayed you and me. And paid for my own bribery. With just a shabby doll. (chorus). He's the tired toy that everyone enjoyed. He wants to be a fancy man but he's nothing but a nancy boy. He's all pride and no joy. And being what you might call a whore. Always worked for me before. Now I'm a shabby doll. Untie the gag the cat's out of the bag. But won't show his claws. He's just a shabby doll. She said you must be joking. Some things are left unspoken. You're just a shabby doll. He's lying limp and soaking. He was openly broken. By just a shabby doll.
3268,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""She's pulling out the pin. That lets her hair fall down. She shakes her head and. It goes tumbling. Her smile was out of place. So she swept it off her face. Let me find the words and say them. Like some softly whispered Amen. As she starts to pull away. And the lights begin to dim. Is she thinking of me. Or is she thinking of him. She's pulling out the pin. She's slipping off the hook. Unbuttoning her dress. There's just enough to make some man a mess. She tears away the veil. With her fingernails. She came out high and kicking. While the band played """"Hey good lookin'"""". Do you hear something ticking?. Did somebody tell her?. You can really be redeemed. Could she actually be?. As desperate as she seems. She's tearing at the seams. She's going to extremes. Nobody told her it was a sin. So she's pulling out the pin. She's taping up her hands. Just as a boxer will. They started laughing. But if looks could kill. She'd take them down right now. She's covering her mouth. With someone or without. There's nothing more to say. This is her wedding day. Full of shattered glass and mayhem. Not one softly whispered amen. She's knocking down some doors. And the smoke begins to fill. Where the world without her ends. And the next one begins. She's pulling out the pin"""
3269,Elvis Costello,Rock,Is it worth it. A new winter coat and shoes for the wife. And a bicycle on the boy's birthday. It's just a rumour that was spread around town. By the women and children. Soon we'll be shipbuilding. Well I ask you. The boy said 'DAD THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ME TO TASK. BUT I'LL BE BACK BY CHRISTMAS'. It's just a rumour that was spread around town. Somebody said that someone got filled in. For saying that people get killed in. The result of this shipbuilding. With all the will in the world. Diving for dear life. When we could be diving for pearls. It's just a rumour that was spread around town. A telegram or a picture postcard. Within weeks they'll be re-opening the shipyards. And notifying the next of kin. Once again. It's all we're skilled in. We will be shipbuilding. WITH ALL THE WILL IN THE WORLD. DIVING FOR DEAR LIFE.
3270,Elvis Costello,Rock,This never was one of the great romances. But I thought you'd always have those young girl's eyes. But now they look in tired and bitter glances. At the ghost of a man who walks 'round in my disguise. I get the feeling that I don't belong here. But there's no welcome in the window anyway. And I look down for a number on my keychain. 'Cause it feels more like a hotel everyday. There's a stranger in the house; nobody's seen his face. But everybody says he's taken my place. There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see. But everybody says he looks like me. And now you say you've got no expectations. But I know you also miss those carefree days. And for all the angry words that passed between us. You still don't understand me when I say. There's a stranger in the house; nobody's seen his face. But everybody says he's taken my place. There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see.
3271,Elvis Costello,Rock,I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. It's amazin' what you will. find stripping paper. When you get down to the past. Back then we didn't have means. for fine decorations. So we painted while mixing wine. with flirtation. There in the mess of it all. He took me right there in the thrill. Not quite against my will. With my back to that rococo wall. We slipped right down to the floor. I can't close the door. he complimented my taste. I anointed his serious face. with wallpaper [pics?]. I wish we could laugh like that now. But what seemed to follow. That ended up hollow. [Was I there?]. Tear a strip or two. See what what came not much later. Here's a pony and a toy balloon. Behind the [violet?] all too soon. Here's the pencil of a measurin' mark. And the monsters you spied in the dark. Now I got no place in her heart. Let me go back to the start. I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. I've got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper
3272,Elvis Costello,Rock,We used to go out walkin' hand in hand. You told me all the big things you had planned. It wasn't long till all your dreams came true. Success put me in second place with you. You have no time to love me anymore. Since fame & fortune knocked upon our door. I spend all my evenings all alone. Success has made a failure of our home. If we could spend an evening now & then. Perhaps we'd find true happiness again. You never hold me like you used to do. It's funny what success has done for you. You have no time to love me anymore. Since fame & fortune knocked upon our door. I spend all my evenings all alone. Success has made a failure of our home.
3273,Elvis Costello,Rock,Lightning Up!. And shake the ground. Is that a horn that's blowing?. Or a bell that's tolling?. Walls are falling. Ships pulled out from their mooring. Is that a river or just a road the storm has stolen?. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work. Lightning Up!. And fly the coop. Far from this tin-pan alley oop. Did you think I was your dupe?. I hear such lies and howlers. Words to pull out your molars. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work. Lightning Up!. Sugar the pill. A wall of ocean ten miles high. Metal darts torn from the sky. Like wanton boys make noise pull wings from flies. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work
3274,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""While Nat King Cole sings """"Welcome To My World"""". You request some song you hate you sentimental fool. And it's the force of habit. If it moves then you fuck it. If it doesn't move you stab it. And I thought I heard """"The Working Man's Blues"""". He went out to work that night and wasted his breath. Outside there was a public execution. Inside he died a thousand deaths. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they put him in a suit of lights. In the perforated first editions. Where they advocate the hangman's noose. Then tell the sorry tale of the spent Princess. Her uncouth escort looking down her dress. Anyway they say that she wears the trousers. And learnt everything that she does. And doesn't know if she should tell him yes. Or let him go. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they put him in a suit of lights. Well it's a dog's life in a rope leash or a diamond collar. It's enough to make you think right now. But you don't bother. For goodness sake as you cry and shake. Let's keep you face down in the dirt where you belong. And think of all the pleasure that it brings. Though you know that it's wrong. And there's still life in your body. But most of it's leaving. Can't you give us all a break. Can't you stop breathing. And I thought I heard """"The Working Man's Blues"""". I went to work that night and wasted my breath. Outside they're painting tar on somebody. It's the closest to a work of art that they will ever be. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they put him in a suit of lights."""
3275,Elvis Costello,Rock,You're a swine and I'm saying that's an insult to the pig. In the foul furrow that you dig. Why don't you lay your head down. In that unconsecrated ground. WAS she your MOTHER?. Or WAS she your bride. To defile and to blister. To gnaw at her side. Is this the end of the world?. Now that you've finished your life.
3276,Elvis Costello,Rock,I know the name on the tip of your tongue. And I know that accusing look. Everybody knows I've been so wrong. That's the problem and here's the hook. Tears before bedtime. There'll be trouble tonight. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I don't want to have another fight. I don't want to talk I don't want to fight. How wrong can I be before I am right. For the tears that you boo hoo hoo hoo. There can be no defence. You say you'll forgive and forget. But it's only a pretence. Either you can leave the past behind. Or give me something to disconnect my mind. I sleep with my fists clenched tight. When I don't lie awake all night. I guess time gave up the ghost too late. And the balance of our love. Very soon turns to hate. Darling your suspiciousness. Tortures me at night. But I can't excuse the cruel words. That I use whenever we fight. (chorus).
3277,Elvis Costello,Rock,Who's this kid with his mumbo jumbo. Living in air-conditioned limbo. Though they treat him just like a guest. He's living under threat of arrest. Now that he's finally trying to make some sense. He drinks in self-defense. Give me temptation. The subtle touch of authority will. Take you anytime down to the station. You say that it's alright by me. Now you're living with the curse of sophistication. Now that you're shackled up to the rigmarole. With absolute control. I see you lying so wide awake. After I've given you all that you can take. So for heaven's sake. Give me temptation. Still you want to succeed so badly. Finding your life will not be deadly. You tell me you can take it or leave it. Sometimes I think that you really believe it. You're just itching to break her secret laws. As you go from claws to clause. Give me temptation. . .
3278,Elvis Costello,Rock,EVERYONE STOPPED WHEN SHE WALKED INTO THE ROOM. Isn't this the greatest thing. Everyone own up but nobody could touch her. Isn't this the greatest thing. PUNCH THE CLOCK keep boxing clever. You'll be young enough for ever. Isn't this the greatest thing. Isn't this THE GREATEST THING. I heard some new confection. Said we can't afford to feel affection. And it's the lastest thing. In and out of matrimony. Never once removed the Sony. 'Cos it's a status thing. So girls like that above described. Are not to be so easily bribed. With a white frock and a ring. PUNCH THE CLOCK and in time you'll get pulled apart. IF YOU'RE MARRIED ON PAPER AND NOT IN YOUR HEART. But I won't be told that life with the one you love is sordid. Just because some authority says you can't afford it. Since nights were long and days were olden. Woman to man has been beholden. But since then times have been changing. She sends back HIS TRIBUTE OF A ROSE. And says this ring is better suited for the nose. He's always fingering. I PUNCH THE CLOCK and it's OK. I KNOW A GIRL WHO TAKES MY BREATH AWAY. And it's the greatest. And it's the greatest thing
3279,Elvis Costello,Rock,Trying to be too bad. Trying to talk too tough. Trying to jack the lad. You'd think he'd had enough. But he's not the man you'd think that he can be. I just don't know why you can't see. That he is only the imposter. That he is only the imposter. You've never been this far. You've always been too smart. And you know all our boys. Are really girls at heart. But he's not.... When I said that I was lying I might have been lying. Never let me hear you say you're not trying. This is your big decision. Hope you're not disappointed. He's got double vision. When you want him double jointed. And he's not.... He'll only bring you souvenirs. It's only gonna end in tears. And he is only the imposter. .
3280,Elvis Costello,Rock,I WAS COMMITTED TO LIFE AND THEN COMMUTED TO THE OUTSKIRTS. With all the love in the world. Living for thirty minutes at a time with a break in the middle for adverts. But it's a wonderful world within these cinema walls. WHERE A SHOWER OF AFFECTION BECOMES NIAGARA FALLS. And you wish she could step down from the screen to your seat in the stalls. BUT IF STARS ARE ONLY PAINTED ON THE CEILING ABOVE. Then who can you turn to and who do you love. I want to get out while I still can. I want to be like Harry Houdini. Now I'm the invisible man. My head is spinning round faster and faster. Here I stand on the edge of disaster. I'm shattered like a piece of crystal porcelain or alabaster. Crowds surround loudspeakers hanging from the lampposts. Listening to the murder mystery. Meanwhile someone's hiding in the classroom. Forging books of history. NEVER MIND THERE'S A GOOD FILM SHOWING TONIGHT. WHERE THEY HANG EVERYONE EVERYBODY WHO CAN READ AND WRITE.
3281,Elvis Costello,Rock,All the bedroom lights go out. As the neighbourhood gets quiet. Everything in heaven and earth is almost right. But there's a wife whos wondering where her husband could be tonight. And when the phone rang only once she took a dreadful fright. Little things just seem to undermine her confidence in him. He was late this time last week. Who can she turn to when the chance of coincidence is slim. 'Cause the baby isn't old enought to speak. There's been a long honeymoon. She thought too late and spoke too soon. There's no money back guarantee on future happiness. There's been a long honeymoon. If he's out on a date then her life's in ruins. She never thought her love could ever be as strong as this. All the movies and the papers. Feature the murders of lonely women. If he isn't in by ten she'll call up her best friend. Why doesn't he come home. Why does her friends phone keep on ringing. Maybe she should just pretend. (chorus).
3282,Elvis Costello,Rock,Don't get smart or sarcastic. He snaps back just like elastic. Spare us the theatrics and the verbal gymnastics. We break wise guys just like matchsticks. What would the loved ones say. Your pride and joy is all blown up. What would the loved ones say. The bride and boy are barely grown up. You're not my particular poison. I've got nothing against you myself. You could have been a danger to the boys and girls. Now you're a danger to yourself. Oh what would the loved ones say. What would the loved ones say. Oh what would the loved ones say. What would the loved ones say. The ugly little scenes run round your bed. The ugly little dreams you get the needle and no thread. They stitched you up this time. They say you'll do. They bitch about your pretty face turning ugly on you. The butcher the baker and the bassline maker. Say you can leave her I can take her. You live your whole life like a minute or two later. One day its going to end sooner than greater. What would the loved ones say. He'll be remembered young and pretty. What would the loved ones say. Now he's a hit in every city. Now there's a name well never forget. There's one born every minute. Dont pin a medal on me yet. They might be waiting for you. (chorus). PPS I love you.
3283,Elvis Costello,Rock,I know a girl got my mind in a mess. I never heard her say goodnight and God bless. She's not the only flame in town. And when we're alone we never quarrel. I'm miles away now here's the moral. She's not the only flame in town. She's not the only flame in town. She's got to stop thinking that I'm. carrying this torch around. He struck a match and it lit up her face. We should have struck a match girl. To burn down the whole place. Now you're not the only flame in town. But you blew hot and cold. Turned my heart to a cinder. And with each passing day. You'd be less tender and more tinder. Now you're not the only flame in town. She's not the only flame in town. She's got to stop thinking that I'm. carrying this torch around. Thought I saw your face in the fire. But it's so hard to remember. Even an inferno can cool down to an ember. Now you're not the only flame. You're not the only flame. You're not the only flame in town. .
3284,Elvis Costello,Rock,Well I recall his parting words. Must I accept his fate?. Or take myself far from this place. I thought I heard a black bell toll. A little bird did sing. Man has no choice. When he wants everything. [Chorus:]. We'll rise above the scarlet tide. That trickles down through the mountain. And separates the widow from the bride. Man goes beyond his own decision. Gets caught up in the mechanism. Of swindlers who act like kings. And brokers who break everything. The dark of night was swiftly fading. Close to the dawn of the day. Why would I want him. Just to lose him again. [Chorus 2x]
3285,Elvis Costello,Rock,(Costello/Nieve). Above the tears. Before the scream. Invisible and secret scar. The true salvation is the human voice. Beloved voices of the past. The forever stiffled voice. Tender echoes. Lost cause. Miserable voice. Whispering voice. Incantations. Immaterial instrument. Attentive mothers. Darkness lighting lullabies. Stare of silence. Cruel disease. The ________ gag of hate. Unfailing welcome to the voice. Be welcome. Attractive red fruit of the mouth. Dangerous message on my skin. I feel so fluid. Lighter than air. Shy caress. A fleeting bride's veil on the throat. Forbidden kisses to drink. _______ siren. Virtuous sound. Vocal pleasure. Pleasure vocal. It's the real way to be drunk. To desert the common place. Sacred [bluesy prophet?]. I'm a slave to the voice. Unfailing welcome to the voice. In every tone a poignant oath. Voices to pray to fly to escape. [harmonized]. The sublimation of the hopes. The sublimation of the hopes. Spiritual vehicle of thought. The voice [is boundless?]. I love the voice.
3286,Elvis Costello,Rock,The very thought of you. And I forget to do. The little ordinary things. That everyone ought to do. I'm living in a kind of daydream. I'm happy as a king. And foolish though it may seem to me. That's everything. The mere idea of you. The longing year for you. You'll never know how slow the moments go. Till I'm near to you. I see your face in every flower. Your eye in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you. My love. The mere idea of you. The longing year for you. You'll never know how slow the moments go. Till I'm near to you. I see your face in every flower. Your eye in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you.
3287,Elvis Costello,Rock,The family circle gather round from very far and near. To pass around the same remarks they passed away last year. The little girl you dangle on your knee without mishap. STIRS SOMETHING IN YOUR MEMORY. AND SOMETHING IN YOUR LAP. But it's a living. This is the life. For the world and his wife. The world and his wife. The kissing cousins slip outside to cuddle and confess. She says sweet nothing at all it's much more of a mess. The conversation melts like chocolate down their open jaws. As the juniper berry slips down just like last night's drawers. To tell the truth our Mum ran off with someone else's father. WENT FOR TWO WEEKS' HOLIDAY IN TARAMASALATA. Daddy went out with the rubbish and he kept on walking. Between Mum and the walls. God only knows who does the talking. But later on in the evening through the tears and fol de rol. Come the sentimental feelings for the lure of vitriol. Longing thoughts go hankering for the old home overseas. WITH A BLINDFOLD AND A NATIONAL ANTHEM. SUNG IN DIFFERENT KEYS.
3288,Elvis Costello,Rock,I write in hopes that by the time you get this letter. We may live to see a change for the better. Or are we so devoted to these wretched selfish motives. When the cold facts and figures all add up. They cannot contradict this sad burlesque. This sad burlesque. With miserable failures making entertainment of our fate. Laughter cannot dignify of elevate. This sad burlesque. Now can they recall being young and idealistic. Before wading knee-deep in hogwash and arithmetic. The pitying smirk. The argument runs like clockwork. Will run down eventually and splutter to a stop. P.S. Well by now you know the worst of it. And we've heard all the alibis that they've rehearsed. The smug predictions. If it's not a contradiction. Keep faith in human nature. And have mercy on the creatures in this sad burlesque.
3289,Elvis Costello,Rock,You can run all you like from the classroom or the cot. From a great big man or a tiny tot. But from this day everyday will be BOXING DAY. Don't need your indecision let there be no doubt. Don't need you permission I can count you out. TKO. They put the numb into number they put the cut into cutie. They put the slum into slumber and the boot into beauty. But from this day everyday will be BOXING DAY. It's a fight to the finish let there be no doubt. As the seconds turn into minutes I can count you out. TKO. You need a back to break or a back to stab. NOW YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT LOOKS DULL AND DRAB. But from this day everyday will be BOXING DAY. NOW YOU DON'T LOOK SO GLAMOROUS. WHENEVER I FEEL SO AMOROUS. I CAN COUNT YOU OUT. TKO. .
3290,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""The sky fell over cheap Korean monster-movie scenery. And spilled into the mezzanine of the crushed capsule hotel. Between the Disney abattoir and the chemical refinery. And I knew I was in trouble but I thought I was in hell. So you look around the tiny room and you wonder where the hell you are. While the K.K.K. convention are all stranded in the bar. They wear hoods and carry shotguns in the main streets of Montgomery. But they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday. Chorus: What do we care if the world is a joke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). We'll give it a big kiss. We'll give it a poke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). We're only living this instant. The black sand stuck beneath her feet in a warm Sorrento sunrise. A barefoot girl from Naples or was it a Barcelona hi-rise. Whistles out the tuneless theme song on a hundred cheap suggestions. And a million false seductions and all those eternal questions. Chorus. So they flew the Super-Constellation all the way from Rimini. And feasted them on fish and chips from a newspaper facsimile. Now dead Italian tourists bodies litter up the Broadway. Some people can't be told you know they have to learn the hard way. Holidays are dirt-cheap in the Costa del Malvinas. In the Hotel Argentina they can hardly tell between us. For Teresa is a waitress though she's now known as Juanita. In a tango bar in Stanley or in Puerto Margarita. She's the sweetest and the sauciest. The loveliest and the naughtiest. She's Miss Buenos Aires in a world of lacy lingerie. Chorus. Japanese got Jesus robots telling teenage fortunes. For all we know and all we care they might as well be Martians. They say gold paint on the palace gates comes from the teeth of pensioners. They're so tired of shooting protest singers. That they hardly mention us. While fountains fill with second-hand perfume. And sodden trading stamps. They'll hang the bullies and the louts that dampen down the day. Chorus. We braved the cold November air and the undertaker's curses. Saying """"Take me to the Folies Bergere and please don't spare the hearses"""". For he always had a dream of that revolver in your purse. How you loved him 'til you hated him and made him cry for mercy. He said """"Don't ever mention my name there or talk of all the nights you cried. We've always been like worlds apart now you're seeing two nightmares collide""""."""
3291,Elvis Costello,Rock,(McCartney/MacManus). She was counting out the window of the outbound train. All the poles of the telegraph. And the rock-a-bye rhythm in the song of the rails. Couldn't make the sweet bird laugh. Down down down so deep. Down down drowning in his sleep. Tommy's coming home again. And a hawk hovered high above a skinny jackrabbit. Pursued by a hungry fox. And a broker awoke her from a fitful slumber. Then consulted his shares and his stocks. Down down down they go. Down down how he'll never know. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. As he glanced on his paper looking through the veil (?). He could see she was really upset. As she tucked back the ribbon in a velvet box. As he offered her a cigarette. Down down down she took a drag. Now he's covered in a flag. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. But how could he know that only twelve months later. She would wear her skirt up over her knee. And in the very same carriage she'd be flattened with roses. And forget the tears of bigotry (?). Down down down they flow. Now now now it just don't matter anymore. Tommy made it home again. When it was almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. Tommy's coming home again. Tommy's coming home again.
3292,Elvis Costello,Rock,Tonight the bottle let me down. It let your memory come around. The one true friend I thought I'd found. Tonight the bottle let me down. I've always had a bottle I could turn to. And lately I've been turnin' every day. But the wine don't take effect the way it used to. And I'm hurtin' in old familiar ways. Tonight the bottle let me down. It let your memory come around. The one true friend I thought I'd found. Tonight the bottle let me down. Each night I leave the bar room when it's over. Not feeling any pain at closing time. But tonight your memory found me much too sober. I can't drink enough to keep you off my mind. Tonight the bottle let me down. It let your memory come around. The one true friend I thought I'd found. Tonight the bottle let me down.
3293,Elvis Costello,Rock,I can tell somewhere there's someone you love more than me. Someone you love more than me. And it hurts to say it that you have a right to be free. I know that's the way it should be. Oh but I'm too far gone. Too far gone. I know I've loved you too much for too long. And I'm too far gone. If ever your new love should hurt you or make you feel blue. Hurt you or make you feel blue. Just remember your old love will still be around loving you. I'll be around loving you. Oh 'cause I'm too far gone. Too far gone. I know I've loved you too much for too long. And I'm too far gone.
3294,Elvis Costello,Rock,I'm the town crier. And everybody knows. I'm a little down. With a lifetime to go. Maybe you don't believe my heart is in the right place. Why don't you take a good look at my face. Other boys use the splendour of their trembling lip. They're so teddy bear tender and tragically hip. I'm never going to cry again. I'm going to be as strong as them. They say they'd die for love. And then they live it out. They'll give you something to cry about. And suddenly you really fall to pieces. I'm the town crier. And everybody knows. I'm a little down. With a lifetime to go. Maybe you don't believe my heart is in the right place. Why don't you take a good look at my face. Other boys use the splendour of their trembling lip. They're so teddy bear tender and tragically hip. Love and unhappiness go arm in arm. Long suffering friends of your fatal charm. Isn't it a pity that you're going to get hurt. Just a little boy lost in a big man's shirt. .
3295,Elvis Costello,Rock,(McCartney-MacManus). Twenty five fingers baby. I love your nails I love your touch. I love to touch you baby. It never fails to kill me. Some say gimme five. But I'll give you ten. You could make it twenty. But you're holding out again. Think it over think it over baby. Well think it over think it over baby. I will always love you. That can't be denied. Love you up until the day. That heaven knows I've tried. For the time being I will tell you this. I'd love to love you love to love you. But there's something missing. Baby listen unconditionally. Put your hand in my hand and surrender to me. Think it over think it over baby. Well think it over think it over baby. Twenty five fingers feel so divine. Twenty five fingers wish you were mine. Wish you were mine. Well so our hands met and twenty fingers entwined. I couldn't help I couldn't help but see. She didn't quite believe me. She said listen cause there's one little thing. Where did you get that lovely wedding ring. Think it over think it over baby. Well think it over think it over baby. Some things are forbidden. Never meant to be. Well that might be all right for you. But not for you and me. Twenty five fingers feel so divine. Twenty five fingers wish you were mine. Wish you were mine.
3296,Elvis Costello,Rock,Blood and Chocolate. I hope you're satisfied what you have done. You think it's over now. But we've only just begun. I asked for water. And they gave me rose' wine. A horse that knows arithmetic. And a dog that tells your fortune. Chorus: It's in your eyes. Uncomplicated. I want to buy you. A big blue Diamel. Cheap white plastic shoes. That don't walk out and don't let in. I want to show you. How I love you. When you're over me. There's no-one above you. Chorus. You think it's over now. But this is only the beginning. Chorus. .
3297,Elvis Costello,Rock,"""You should hear the things that they say about me. They're saying """"She's no better than she needed to be"""". They don't know that he was kind and strong and tender. And now I'll never be another Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number. How can I tell them?. How can I express?. How it felt to step out of this life and into his embrace. How can I tell them?. How can I explain?. All the love that I never had I found in him. There may be a stain on the family name. And if my father was here I think I know who he'd blame. Mama says that he just doesn't care to remember. And all he thinks of me is another Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number. (How can I tell her?. How can I express?. How it felt when he came to my room. And helped me to undress. What can she tell me?. How can I believe. That she really didn't hear me cry. When he wouldn't leave?). There's a local game where they whisper my shame. They say """"; He gave her his child. He wouldn't give her his name"""". They will torture me from January till September. And soon there's going to be another Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number. Unwanted number. And I will give my love to another Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number"""
3298,Elvis Costello,Rock,Upon a veil of midnight blue. There hung a crescent moon. To light the view. But I don't whisper the words. When the moment arose. I wonder how he knows. You say your tongue is tied. Your words escape and hide. But he's so patient and kind. He's prepared to read your mind. That's very well till you find. Because of the wine you drank. Your mind is still a blank. I wonder how he knows. I guess I will wonder until. I pluck up the courage to tell him. How I feel. So close I can feel his heart tremble. That look in his eyes as they close. I wonder how he knows. I wonder how he knows.
3299,Elvis Costello,Rock,Will you walk us uptown?. And wherever you go. You know we will follow. Will you walk us uptown?. And we'll stand in the light. Of your new killing ground. And we won't make a sound. Except to sing our sorrow. Will you walk us uptown?. While our tears run in torrents. To suffer in silence or pray for some solace. Will you wash away our sins. In the cross-fire and cross-currents. As you uncross your fingers. And take out some insurance. No matter what the price. It's your own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. Some hearts are sinking. And some hearts are a-flutter. Some scoop gold from the dirt in the gutter. Or swallow the earth. Pouring into your mouth. As they bury us upright saying. 'Everything's alright'. Will you walk us uptown?. Like some said that you could. We will feast on your flesh. And drink down your blood. Will you haul down that flag. And dishonour that vow. Cause we must not change. It's color now. Will you walk us uptown?. No matter what the price. Each crushed in the corner of their own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. That's always assuming. That you're partly divine and partly human. You're the king of our hearts. You're the clown with the drum. Will you walk us uptown?. If we promise not to run. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you gather us near. As cowards flee and traitors sneer. Keep a red flag flying. Keep a blue flag as well. And a white flag in case it all goes to hell
3300,Elvis Costello,Rock,Don't say a word. Don't say anything. Don't say a word. I'm not even listening. I read in the paper about their escape. They're just two BITTER kids WITH a bunch of sour grapes. You better watch your step. Watch who's knocking on your front door. Now you know that they're watching. What are you waiting for?. Think you're young and original. Get out before.... They get to watch your step. Ev'ry day is full of fun. And family spies. They're making heroes out of fall guys. They say it's good for business. From Singapore to Widnes. You better watch your step. Broken noses hung up on the wall. Back slapping drinkers cheer the heavy weight brawl. So punch drunk they don't understand at all. You better watch your step. Ev'ry night. Go out full of carnival desires. End up in the closing time choirs. When you're kicking in the courtroom. And you're drinking down the Eau de Cologne. And you're spitting out the Kodachrome. You better watch your step. Bye. I send you all my regards. You're so tough. You're so hard. Listen to the hammers falling in the breaker's yard. You better watch your step. You better watch your step.
3301,Elvis Costello,Rock,All the words you say to me. Have music in them. All the sorrows and the joys like magnetism. And a selfish boy looks through a prism. And says what is. But never asks what isn't. But a voice contains many precious things. It laughs. And then it sings. And all the lies that we can tell. To our foolish selves. Maybe this is the love song that I refused to. Write her when I loved her like I used to. And I fear my heart may spin and fracture. Like tears of stone falling from a statue. But a voice contains all that's true and false. Then cries for someone else. And for some honest tenderness. So I must confess. All the words you say to me. Have music in them. All the sorrows and the joys like magnetism. And a selfish boy looks through a prism. And says what is.
3302,Elvis Costello,Rock,When that I was and a little tiny boy. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. A foolish thing was but a toy. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came to man's estate. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came alas to wife. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. By swaggering I could never fright. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came unto my bed. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. With tosspots still a drunken head. For the rain it raineth. Every day. A great while ago the world began. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. But that's all one our play is done. And we'll strive to please you. Every day.
3303,Elvis Costello,Rock,Why is Daddy not here?. Are you crying?. Why?. Does he still love me?. Will you take care of me?. If you both love me so. Why don't you love each other. Mummy's gone missing. Daddy's on fire. Daddy's on fire.
3304,Elvis Costello,Rock,Am I fine? Am I pleasing?. Are you pitying? Are you teasing?. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Should a glance from you just shoot through me. If a glimpse of you could undo me. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Time among all of your enemies. Leaves you nothing but bitter memories. From the first splash of affection. To avoiding your own reflection. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Now the flashbulbs bedazzle. While you're figuring out the spasm. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Don't take more than I offer. All my love or I'll make you suffer. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Time among all of your enemies. Makes disguises from drastic melodies. From the first splash of detection. To avoiding your own reflection. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. . You shouldn't look at me that way
3305,Elvis Costello,Rock,You turned to me. And all at once. I knew I was betrayed. My eyes met yours just down the darkened path. Where both of us had strayed. Nothing good can come out of this. I know it may not be. But just then you turned to me. And I thought for a moment. Like the fool that I've become. I might be the one. To turn these lights back on. Just as I began to say. It's never worth the price you pay. I was going there anyway. You turned to me. And all at once. I knew that you had seen. How I was lost in something quite like love. When all I did was dream. Now as evening becomes the dawn. I wonder where you'll be.
3306,A Corte Animal,Rock,Quando jovens por assim dizer. Não se é nada. Além do que pode tocar. Tudo encantava. Tudo se é cada. Como cada gota irmã. De chuva. Como tapetes sujos. Os prédios tremulam. Ao por do Sol. Se o concreto dança. Eu também quero calor. À deriva. (Eu permaneço). À deriva. (Não há desfecho). À deriva. À deriva. Agora podemos assim dizer. Que tudo se desvaira. Muito antes de conhecer. Agora o tempo é movediço. E as lembranças um feitiço. Que passou e nem vimos. Como motoqueiros. Aviões tucanos costuram. O céu por aqui. Se a nuvem é nossa. Eu também quero te abraçar. À deriva. (Eu permaneço). À deriva. (Não há desfecho). À deriva. À deriva. Sempre um novo adeus. Não é mesmo?. Forço-me a acreditar. Em recomeço
3307,A Corte Animal,Rock,Nobre tristeza que dá cara a tapa. E as outras mil faces. Que podia. Agora você entende meu coração navaia. Passando por tudo. Se passando de poesia. Eu sei eu tenho muita pressa. Mas não sei enrolar. Uma boa prece. Quem de fato está no agora?. Somos a conseqüência do passado. E a insistência do futuro. Eu quero um dia. Em que não precise mais. Esperar pelo outro. Como fantasmas que quebram a cara. Um vazio reconhece o outro. O outro. Reconhece o outro baby. Como fantasmas. Que quebram a cara. Como fantasmas. Que quebram a cara. Como fantasmas. Que quebram a cara. Como fantasmas
3308,A Volta,Rock,Tudo Ou Nada. Eu sei você vai me dizer. Que eu não devo mais esconder. O quanto batalhei por ti. Sem que você se preocupasse de verdade. Contei o quanto engoli. Seus caprichos e vontades. Antes de decidir. Se era melhor partir pra liberdade. Quem decide agora sou eu. Quem se importa se você perdeu?. Não há mais quem culpar. Dê adeus a quem for chegar. O que é que vai ficar pra se lembrar?. Não há mais placas no caminho dessa estrada. Venha me mostrar qual foi a curva errada. A essa altura eu já parti pro tudo ou nada. Você vai continuar. Sem entender de fato. Se foi por sua causa. Ou se fui apenas ingrato. Contei o quanto engoli. Seus caprichos e vontades. Antes de decidir. Se era melhor partir pra liberdade. Quem decide agora sou eu. Quem se importa se você perdeu?. Não há mais quem culpar. Dê adeus a quem for chegar. O que é que vai ficar pra se lembrar?. Não há mais placas no caminho dessa estrada. Venha me mostrar qual foi a curva errada. A essa altura eu já parti pro tudo ou nada. [x3]
3309,Alesana,Rock,Sweat drips in my eyes. Screams of lust we cry. Tonight you are everything. You?re everything. You?re everything to me no more. As i wake from this perfect dream. I?ll escape from eden?s walls. Can i not stay and live this lie?. Go away and i?ll think only of myself. And to think that you would not be scared or surprised if i?d severed all these ties. This is the end. I?ll lose myself in anguish for tonight. Help me get over you. One last false apology. Help me get over you. I feel so numb to see this bitter end of beautiful illusions. Would this be the same?. Broken pieces will not mend to save our past now. Go away. I?ll lose myself in anguish for tonight. Help me get over you. One last false apology. Help me get over you. Now we must let go. Urgency overwhelms me as i must restrain my flood of tears. I refuse to be slave to your false beauty again. I?ll lose myself in anguish for tonight. Help me get over you. One last false apology. Help me get over you. In my mind. Blood drips from your eyes. A beautiful last goodbye. One last false apology. Help me get over you. Now we must let go. Urgency overwhelms me as i must restrain my flood of tears. I refuse to be slave to your false beauty again. I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight. Help me get over you. One last false apology. Help me get over you
3310,Alesana,Rock,We should go ahead and kill her right now. But her eyes are so lovely. I can't wait! Just imagine how she will suffer!. Would someone please tell me I'm not alright. How could you fall for my charming charade?. Days fade but guilt still burns inside of me. I feel as if I am responsible. Why can't I just how the pieces seem to fit?. I feel as if I am responsible. Does she know before I met her I have only dreamt of so much blood?. So why is she tempting me?. Can you see the visions of pain?. How could I? Is that possible?. You must give her to me!. I'm tired of washing my hands clean of what I've done. 'Tis to a murderer's den you have come. Days fade but guilt still burns inside of me. I feel as if I am responsible. Why can't I just how the pieces seem to fit?. I feel as if I am responsible. Something in this empty room is telling me that I should run!. Its time we throw away the mask. What have we done?. We got too attached!. We can't let her escape!. We let her escape!. This is the last time we ever have to speak again!. She is no longer yours!. We can't let her escape!. She's all mine!. Days fade but guilt still burns inside of me. I feel as if I am responsible. Why can't I just how the pieces seem to fit?. I feel as if I am responsible. Does she know before I met her I had only dreamt of so much blood?. So why is she tempting me?

3313,Alesana,Rock,Black engulfs the dying light. as he falls. on frail wings of vanity and wax
3314,Alesana,Rock,Memories saved destined to capture. Decades passing by a way to remember. (We need to remember). Moments fade leaving to rejoin decades passing by. Let's savor the present but not lose the future. The shifting sands of time pour from the past. But you don't know then what you hate to now. I try to argue but I'm not getting through. Close your eyes and sing along with me. Relive the memory. We've been here before. And I'm begging for more a destination so beautiful. I'm speechless. Idle hand are the devil's playground. Problem solved. Get off your ass and pretend that you care. Nothing will change if we don't stand and fight. Call us to arms into the night. If we all take it for granted music soon will die. It's vanishing slowly through ignorant madness. If you see what's wrong take a stand and scream out loud. If they want silence then disappoint them all!. I try to argue but I'm not getting through. Close your eyes and sing along with me. Relive the memory. We've been here before. And I'm begging for more a destination so beautiful. I'm speechless. I'm speechless.... A positive metal attitude. Dare to put your pen to the page. Fearlessly imagine your own tale. Opens doors and we're walking through. The music survives if we keep the songs alive. Step inside and relive the dream of a young boy. Who tried to sing and managed to fly. His story should never die. Idle hand are the devil's playground problem solved. Get off your ass and pretend that you care. Nothing will change if we don't stand and fight. Call us to arms into the night. With smiles and open arms we all embrace the underdog. DREAM!. Dream of a yet unvisited renaissance. A time when music will shimmer with hope!. I try to argue but I'm not getting through. Close your eyes.... I try to argue but I'm not getting through. Close your eyes and sing along with me. Relive the memory. We've been here before. And I'm begging for more a destination so beautiful. I'm speechless
3315,Alesana,Rock,you've taken the last of me. the god’s of your innocence shall not protect you from the hate of my wrath. you've taken the last of me…blame the end on yourself. you deserve each tear that falls…scratch out your eyes. the blood will drown in red and I will leave you for dead. a lovely evening draped in regret. the shadow of justice now engulfs you. as cold hands reap the pain they've sewn. you’ve taken the last of me...blame the end on yourself. you deserve each tear that falls...scratch out your eyes. the blood will drown in red and I will leave you for dead. a lovely evening draped in regret. Forever gone...the taste of your death replaced the smell of your breath. a lovely evening draped in regret. suffocate your will to live with my pain. you were so easily seduced by greed. you could never feel my calloused hands closing around your throat. taste your loss...wake into the nightmare that has become our love. may your screams never cease. you've taken the last of me.... . ... Cássio Bouvier =]
3316,Alesana,Rock,Last night I forgot. How the sound. Of your voice. Whispered sweet. Goodbyes. Your eyes. Left to die. Im alone to understand why. Why not one more night. One last kiss goodbye. My sweet love tonight. I hope the stars still spell. Out your name. Where you are. Kiss my closing eyes. Help me sleep. Without you im so lost. Tonight I cry. Tell me why. I cant live with. Out your warm embrace. Why not one more night. One last kiss goodbye. My sweet love tonight. I hope the stars still spell. Out your name. Where you are. I close my eyes and you. Are everything I see. Goodbye. Goodbye to you my love. I won't forget you. Ill see you soon. Goodbye my love. Goodbye to you my love. I won't forget you. Bye my love
3317,All Time Low,Rock,Rush of the pass. I quietly crash. and the tables turn. You're beautiful strange. Definitely brash. Be careful now. Kid you're cut above always just cut about the rest. If there's something left to be learned. Then my time is running. Why should wasted it all. Wasted on you. I shouldn be trusted. To live and let go. When the last of my cities have burned. Then what's left in nothing. Why did i wasted it all. Wasted on you. I couldn't be trusted. To live and let go. Fill in the blanks. Pencil on paper. Disposable. Throw away lines. Intentional but unbelievable. Kid you're cut above always just cut about the rest. If there's something left to be learned. Then my time is running. Why should wasted it all. Wasted on you.

3318,All Time Low,Rock,When will the princess figure it out. She ain't worth saving. Heavy the head that bears the crown of my mistaken. Apathy for symphaty. I was never good enough to be. Anything but a remedy. To all of your constant pressing needs. And I never learned. So I painted a picture of. The things I wanted most. To colour in the darker side of. All my brightest hopes. But there's a monster standing where you should be. So I'll paint you wings. And I'll set you free. I was a pawn in all your plans. You kept me busy. Locked behind your chamber doors. When you felt frisky. Until you got sick of me. I was never good enough to be. Anything but a remedy. To all of your constant pressing needs. And I never learned. So I painted a picture of.

3319,All Time Low,Rock,Praying won't do it. Hating won't do it. Drinking won't do it. Fighting won't knock you out. Of my head. Hiding won't hide it. Smiling won't hide it. Like I ain't tried it. Everyone's tried it now. And failed somehow. So when you gonna let me. When you gonna let me out - out. And if you know. How do you get up from an all time low. I'm in pieces. Seems like peace is. The only thing I'll never know. How do you get up. Get up. ‘Cos driving won't do it. Flying won't do it. Denying won't do it. Crying won't drown it out. What you said. When I'm standing on the yellow line. Waiting at the station. Or I'm late for work. A vital presentation. If you call me now girl. Without reservation. I would try to break through. But if you know. How do you get up from an all time low. I'm in pieces. It seems like peace is. The only thing I never know. How do you get up from an all time low. I can't even find a place to start. How do I choose between my head and heart. Till it ceases I never know. How do you get up from an all time low. A low (repeat). Can you hear me. A low (repeat). Can't you hear me. A low (repeat). Can you hear me. But if you know. How do you get up from an all time low. I'm in pieces. It seems like peace is. The only thing I never know. How do you get up from an all time low.

3320,All Time Low,Rock,I wish you could see your face right now. 'Cause you're grinning like a fool. And we're sitting on your kitchen floor. On a Tuesday afternoon. Doesn't matter when we get back. To doing what we do. 'Cause right now could last forever. Just as long as I'm with you. You're just a daydream away. I wouldn't know what to say if I had you. And I'll keep you a daydream away. Just watch from a safe place. So I never have to lose. We would go out on the weekend. To escape our busy lives. And we'd laugh at all the douche-bag guys. Chasing down their desperate wives. I would drink a little too much. And you'd offer me a ride. I would offer you a t-shirt. And you would stay another night. You're just a daydream away. I wouldn't know what to say if I had you. And I'll keep you a daydream away. Just watch from a safe place. So I never have to lose. We never stood a chance out there. Shooting love in real-time. So we'll take it over ice tonight. With a little salt. And a little lime. You're just a daydream away. I wouldn't know what to say if I had you. And I'll keep you a daydream away. Just watch from a safe place. So I never have to lose
3321,All Time Low,Rock,Redesign me. State of the art. Erase my mind. Replace my heart. I wanna start over. Redefine me. Take me apart. Change my mind. Change my heart. And let me start over
3322,All Time Low,Rock,I know I've been a real bad guy. My name's made the list more than a few times. You could light up a candle. For every mistake that I've made. And I'd follow them home with you. On a pity parade. For years and years I pushed you aside. But never again. Wrap me up like a present and put me away. And when it gets cold I'll be yours. Let the bells ring on a fool's holiday. I swear that I'm more than just broken promises. Decorations can change like tinsel and ribbon so. Do not open 'til you've got forever to spend. With me on a fool's holiday. I've always lived too selfishly. Nobody's perfect babe. But I never tried to be. So every second I've poisoned. And all of the minutes you spent on me. I'd give my whole life's worth of hours. To fix what I've broken in the first place. For years and years I pushed you aside. But never again so. Wrap me up like a present and put me away. And when it gets cold I'll be yours. Let the bells ring on a fool's holiday. I swear that I'm more than just broken promises. Decorations can change like tinsel and ribbon so. Do not open 'til you've got forever to spend. With me on a fool's holiday. Tie me in ribbons and put me away. Know that I'll always be yours. Bells will ring on a fool's holiday.

3324,All Time Low,Rock,I'm lost in empty pillow talk again. I'm lost in empty pillow talk again. This bed's an island. Made of feather down. And I'm stuck here alone. With little else but memories of you. On memory foam. Visions of a brighter love. I'd kill for one more day. To pool my thoughts. And find the words to say. If these sheets were states. And you we're miles away. I'd fold them end over end. To bring you closer to me. Because I don't need to sleep at all. Without you pressed up against me. I settle for long distance calls. I'm lost in empty pillow talk again. I'm lost in empty pillow talk again. This room's become a mausoleum. Filled with relics of regret. Paying dues to every moment wasted. On words left unsaid. Collisions of a finer love. I'd kill for one more way. To tel you how. You make me better every day. If these sheets were states. And you we're miles away. I'd fold them end over end. To bring you closer to me. Because I don't need to sleep at all. Without you pressed up against me. I settle for long distance calls. I'm lost in empty pillow talk again.

3328,All Time Low,Rock,Back in 95. A little boy from just outside of London. Took a fated trip across the ocean. A little did he know. That he would find. His voice in verse and chorus. Making wishes on his broken stereo. Can't shake the noise from his bones. Hear it all play out in distant echoes. So long soldier. Cruise controller. Satellite trajectory. Guide us into reverie. And come down. To voice a generation. Late 2005. The boy's got plans. As crazy as his friends. They take their chance. Driving west alone. Give 'em six more years. And see what time will do. For hopeless dreamers. Singing wishes. To their broken stereo. You can't shake the noise. From their bones. Hear it all play out. In distant echoees. So long soldier. Cruise controller. Satellite trajectory. Guide us into reverie. And come down. To voice a generation. So long soldier. Cruise controller. Satellite trajectory. Guide us into reverie. And come down. To voice a generation
3329,All Time Low,Rock,Thanks to you. Thanks to you. I'm moving on. Chasing out my skeletons. And the troubles they have caused. And all thanks to you. I'm turning over. The pages in this book of revelations. About self-medication. But there's this ringing in my head. (Who said it was gonna be easy). As the gost of you hangs over my bed. Thanks to you. I'm not myself. I'm all strung out. That much is clear. And I'll spend my. Whole life-time with your life-line. Wrapped around my throat. Thanks to you. All thanks to you. Thanks to you I've lost my touch. I struggle to find the sense. In making sense. And giving a semblance of a fuck. And thanks to you. For all the nightmares. There's not a night. That I sleep quiet and complacent. Without my medication. Cause there's this ringing in my head. (Who said it was gonna be easy). As the gost of you hangs over my bed. Thanks to you. I'm not myself. I'm all strung out. That much is clear. And I'll spend my. Whole life-time with your life-line. Wrapped around my throat. Thanks to you. All thanks to you. But there's this ringing in my head.

3330,All Time Low,Rock,Stop fucking around with my emotions. I like you better when you're numb. I'm sick and tired of false devotion. Devote yourself to moving on. Or suck it up. And let it go. But you're always out get me. You're the snake hidden in my daffodils. When i'm picking flowers. That's just my luck these days. Why can't you just be happy for me. You're the brake lines. Falling as my car. Swerves off the freeway. It kind of feels like sabotage. Why can't you just be happy for.... Why can't you just be happy for me. You think your opinions make you savvy. Your running mouth falls on deaf ears. You say you're winning cause you're laughing. Well i'm crying crocodile tears. Just suck it up and let it go. But you're always out get me.

3331,All Time Low,Rock,Praying won't do it. Hating won't do it. Drinking won't do it. Fighting won't knock you out. Of my head. Hiding won't hide it. Smiling won't hide it. Like I ain't tried it. Everyone's tried it now. And failed somehow. So when you gonna let me. When you gonna let me out - out. And if you know. How do you get up from an all time low. I'm in pieces. Seems like peace is.

There's so much more I have to learn from you. I swear I'll miss you when you're gone. We all fall down. But you refuse to get back on your feet again. You closed your eyes. and said goodbye to all of those who loved you. And as you tried to break this strength. What happens never seems to have an end. you couldn't stay no more. And as you took your final breath. Would your dreams come forth or have an end. Did you fade away?. There's so much more i have to learn from you. The past will miss you now you're gone. We all fall down. But you refuse to get back on your feet again. you closed your eyes. and said goodbye to all of those who loved you

Tenha o seu próprio dogma tenha a sua. Própria crença não siga a crença. De ninguém não faça o que eles querem não faça. O que eles pensa. Seja você. Seja a diferença. Todos são igual mais em diferentes graus

3366,Aura,Rock,Eu sou eu mesmo. Não quero ser melhor do que ninguém. Mas agradeço se eu puder me expressar. Não desrespeito quem discordar de mim. Aceito opinião contraria. E continuarei a desejar. Felicidade a quem não for como eu. Não preciso fazer tudo igual. Entenda se de vez em quando eu tentar. Te auxiliar a ser um pouco melhor. Não quero ser egoísta a ponto de pensar. Somente em mim. Orgulhar quem amo. Orgulhar quem amo. Orgulhar quem amo. Orgulhar quem amo. Orgulhar quem amo. Não vou levantar a voz. para impor meus ideais. Vou dialogar e sobrepor o amor
3367,Aura,Rock,Eu vou fazer diferente. E ser o que eu sempre quis ser. Nadar contra a corrente e dizer. Que faria de novo. Fazer uma viagem. Correr em direção ao céu. Deixar claro o que quero e ser. Honesto comigo mesmo. Por que não ser um cara anormal?. Buscando um novo ideal. Cansado de ser tudo igual. Viver sem um ponto final. Eu vou parar lá na frente. E ser o que eu sempre quis ser. Viver amores ardentes pro meu peito aquecer. Quero poder ser eu mesmo. Beber e não ter que lembrar. Nadar em um mar transparente e dizer. Dinheiro não é tudo. Por que não ser alguém pela paz?. Sem ter que correr atrás. Do bem material pra preencher. O que um abraço completa. Quero vencer os meus medos. Não deixar o tempo passar em vão. Nadar contra a corrente e dizer. Que faria de novo
3368,Aura,Rock,A vida te prende. Você não sabe mas é assim que se aprende. Mas isso é normal. Achar que a vida e o mundo inteiro. Estão contra a gente. Alimente a sua mente com informação e alegria. Que com certeza a sua mente vai pra frente. Vai pra frente. Mas se você se estressar. Feche os olhos e erga as mãos. E no compasso desse som cante com a gente. Oiô oio io Iô. Oiô oio io Iô. Oiô oio io Iô. Oiô oio io Iô. Se entenda e pacifique sua missão. Faça valer a pena sua dedicação em viver. Em seguir. Então prosperar. As amizades sempre vem em primeiro lugar. Não se oprima e não deixe ninguém te diminuir. Todos aqui vão vencer. Eu posso sentir. Quando vejo todos cantando assim. Oiô oio io Iô. Oiô oio io Iô. Oiô oio io Iô. Oiô oio io Iô
3369,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,Take the time just to listen. When the voices screaming are much too loud. Take a look in the distance. Try and see it all. Chances are that you might find. That we share a common discomfort now. I feel I'm walking a fine line. Tell me only if it's real. Still I'm on my way (on and on it goes). Vacant hope to take. Hey!. I can't live in here for another day. Darkness. Has kept the light concealed. Grim as ever. Hold on. To faith as I dig another grave. Meanwhile. The mice endure the wheel. Real as ever. And it seems I've been buried alive. I walked the fields through the fire. Taking steps until I found solid ground. Followed dreams reaching higher. Couldn't survive the fall. Much has changed since the last time. And I feel a little less certain now. You know I jumped at the first sign. Tell me only if it's real. Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes). Wash my view away. Hey!. I can't live in here for another day. Darkness. Has kept the light concealed. Grim as ever. Hold on. To faith as I dig another grave. Meanwhile. The mice endure the wheel. Real as ever. And I'm chained like a slave. Trapped in the dark. Slammed all the locks. Death calls my name. And it seems I've been buried alive. Take you down now. Burn it all out. Throw you all around. Get your fucking. Hands off me!. What's it feel like?. Took the wrong route. Watch it fall apart. Now you're knocking. At the wrong gate!. For you to pay the toll. A price for you alone. The only deal you'll find. I'll gladly take your soul. While it seems sick. Sober up quick. Psycho lunatic. Crushing you with. Hands of fate!. Shame to find out. When it's too late. But you're all the same. Trapped inside. Inferno awaits!. Evil thoughts can hide. I'll help release the mind. I'll peel away the skin. Release the dark within. This is now your life. Strike you from the light. This is now your life. Die buried alive. This is now your life. Strike you from the light. This is now your life. Die buried alive. This is now your life. Die buried alive
3370,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,Freed of the world. Shed of the weight. Onward to see you my friend. Light years above. (take me higher). Time seems to wait. (take me higher). Promise to see you again. It haunts to remember. All the memories of that day. Pre-flight demonstration. Led to desperate voices fueled by flames. Now I'm out here waitin'. Hoping you would send a sign. Came a million miles. And the earth grows small. As I lovingly leave it behind. Freed of the world. Shed of the weight. Onward to see you my friend. We seem to have found it. All the hope we've been denied. There's more than we've been told. Had to find it on the other side. Now I must be dreaming. Face against the frozen glass. But there's no return now. And the blazing worlds salute. As we go flying past. Freed of the world. Shed of the weight. Onward to see you my friend. Light years above. (take me higher). Time seems to wait. (take me higher). Promise to see you again. Meet you in the stars tonight. There you find me drifting. In the ether within the hill
3371,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,Wake the ones and rise tonight. Fallen souls we shine so bright. Rise now and ever. Forgotten memories. No one can touch us
3372,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,Instrumental
3373,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,It is the evening of the day. I sit and watch the children play. Smiling faces I can see. But not for me. I sit and watch. As tears go by. My riches can't buy everything. I want to hear the children sing. All I hear is the sound. Of rain falling on the ground. I sit and watch as tears go by. It is the evening of the day. I sit and watch the children play. Doing things I used to do. They think are new. I sit and watch as tears go by

3377,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,I've been away. Searching for a reason. Another purpose to find. I've sailed the seas. Fought my many demons. I've looked to gods in the skies. I've stood in hell. Where many had to suffer. I stared the devil in the eyes. Walked many roads. To witness ancient idols. And found the great Gates of fire. Had many storms. Question my conviction. Gave armies reason to rise. The hangman's searching. For bones he can borrow. while I scaped in the night. Fight or flight!. Live again. All roads end. I'll be coming home. Tend your light. Cause on this night. I'll be coming home. I escaped the hail. Of calculated mortars. then drunk the blood of a king. A desert rain. has washed away direction. Had angels looking after me. So it seems. Live again. All roads end. I'll be coming home. Tend your light. Cause on this night. I'll be coming home. (Solo). My story ends. Not far from where it started. My weary limbs have grown old. I've seen the world. Through the eyes of a nomad. Home is where the heart is. I've been told. So I go. Live again. All roads end. I'll be coming home. Tend your light. Cause on this night. I'll be coming home. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. I'm coming home
3378,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,What's the matter dear. Seems the ghost is in your stall. For a thousand years. Taured lived within us all. I've come from somewhere beyond. Lost in a world. Voyage in time. Shot through the worm. Scaling the vine. Here in '54. Tastes the napalm fill the sky. Axis wins the war. Seems the crop of our divide. I've slipped through bodies aligned. Lost in the world. Voyage in time. Shot through the worm. Scaling the vine. All that's me and all that's you. All that's false and all that's true. On the sea you sailed away. Another you'd surely stay. It's only fabric so it seems our intimate reality. We're living simultaneously while parallel in possibility. Lost in the world. Voyage in time. Shot through the worm. Scaling the vine. Lost in the world. Voyage in time. Shot through the worm. Scaling the vine
3379,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,Lights paint the windows in the sky. The past is sewn. In pursuit our spirit shown. But for now there's no one home. Heavens work on borrowed time. (walk alone). Empty pages burn forever mine. (walk alone). Masquerade us upon high. (walk alone). All we are is all we've left behind. My sweet medusa. Reflect the empty in our behind. Snakes born of fire. Conjure the demons in our dreams. In void we illustrate our lives. Emerge in small. Heed the sign meant to evolve. To the end we send the call. Heavens work on borrowed time. (walk alone). Empty pages burn forever mine. (walk alone). Masquerade us upon high. (walk alone). All we are is all we've left behind. Where children shiver in the cold. The sun will shine. Just a touch to heal the blind. In ourselves we hope to find. Heavens work on borrowed time. (walk alone). Empty pages burn forever mine. (walk alone). Masquerade us upon high. (walk alone). All we are is all we've left behind. Alone
3380,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,I may not always love you. But long as there are stars above you. You never need to doubt it. I'll make you so sure about it. God only knows what I'd be without you. If you should ever leave me. Though life would still go on believe me. The world could show nothing to me. So what good would living do me. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows what I'd be without you. If you should ever leave me. Well life would still go on believe me. The world could show nothing to me. So what good would living do me. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows what I'd be without you. God only knows. God only knows what I'd be without you

3385,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,Before you advertise. All the fame is implied. With no fortune unseen. Sell the rights. To your blight. Time-machine. While I'm dulled by excess. And a cynic at best. My art imitates crime. Paid for by. The allies. So invest. Now I'm finding truth is a ruin. Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing. Staring into glassy eyes. Mesmerized. There's a vintage thirst returning. But I'm sheltered by my channel-surfing. Every famine virtual. Retrovertigo. A tribute to false memories. With conviction. Cheap imitation. Is it fashion or disease?. Post-ironic. Remains a mouth to feed. Sell the rights. To your blight. And you'll eat. See the vintage robot wearied. Then awakened by revision theories. Every famine virtual. Retrovertigo

3388,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,We've been through hell. Sewn up our eyes. Found fuel in meds. Viewed through the narrow. Encouraged fear when so inclined. Bought peace through wars. That doomed our children to die. Ego is sure to fix the world. Served up to happy boys and girls. I'd make a decision if granted the privilege. But I'm afraid my taste is unrefined. And no one likes cheap wine. When the clouds kiss your eye. Shadows stain on the high-rise. Raise your thumb to the sky. Fossilize. You own the burg. We sleep in streets. You dine then waste. We forage to eat. Well who pays the tab. When you cross the line?. Who writes the check?. Who's herding the swine?. Just takes a fence to rule the roost. As long as the scale has been reduced. How can we see the outside of the pen. When survival has possession of our minds?. Calmly walk the line. When the clouds kiss your eye. Shadows stain on the high-rise. Raise your thumb to the sky. Fossilize. All good things come with time. When you know then you'll know. Such a marvelous find in an illusion. (vlader lauder sat in sorrow. For all his teeth had gone. He drank sweet rum. While fingering his gun. And eyeballed a feast. Not one bite he could eat. Somebody cut off his head!). Dear radiation my sweet friend. Let agents dance upon my nerves. Let sunlight glow under my skin. Let toxins seep into my soul. When the clouds kiss your eye. Shadows stain on the high-rise. Raise your thumb to the sky. Fossilize. All good things come with time. When you know then you'll know. Such a marvelous time. I will find in an illusion. It's an illusion
3389,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,The wind of life and air from above smells of death.. Angels sing of the end.. Nothing you say and nothing you try can change time.. Human race prepares to die...
3390,Avenged Sevenfold,Rock,Wake the ones and rise tonight. Fallen souls we shine so bright. Rise now and ever. Forgotten memories. No one can touch us
3391,Banda Noveset,Rock,Você deve estar tão distante de mim. em algum lugar nesse mundo sem fim. meu amor se sonhar. você pode chegar. aqui dentro do meu coração. Pode até me abraçar e. também me beijar. pode até me despir e assim me sentir. meu amor se sonhar. você pode chegar. aqui dentro do meu coração. Por maior que seja o mundo. não pode nos separar. ligue o radio e escute a nossa canção tocar. Não estou aí presente. mas meu pensamento é seu. os acordes vão tocando. o meu coração e o seu. Meu amor se sonhar. você pode chegar. aqui dentro do meu coração. Meu amor se sonhar. você pode chegar. aqui dentro do meu coração
3392,Black Sabbath,Rock,Revolution in their minds. The children start to march. Against the world in which they have to live. and all the hate that's in their hearts. They're tired of being pushed around. And told just what to do. They'll fight the world until they've won. And love comes flowing through. Children of tomorrow live in. The tears that fall today. Will the sunrise of tomorrow. Bring them peace in any way. Must the world live. In the shadow of atomic fear. Can they win the fight for peace. Or will they disappear?. So you children of the world. Listen to what I say. If you want a better place to live in. Spread the words today. Show the world that love. Is still alive you must be brave. Or you children of today. Are children of the grave
3393,Black Sabbath,Rock,Now the first day that I met ya. I was looking in the sky. When the sun turned all a blur. And the thunderclouds rolled by. The sea began to shiver. And the wind began to moan. It must've been a sign for me. To leave you well alone. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. You never said you love me. And I don't believe you can. 'cause I saw you in a dream. And you were with another man. You looked so cool and casual. And I tried to look the same. But now i've got to know ya. Tell me who am I to blame?. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. Now the whole wide world is movin'. 'cause there's iron in my heart. I just can't keep from cryin'. 'cause you say we've got to part. Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone. And watch you slowly take away. A love i've never known. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. Just a lit bit to strong
3394,Black Sabbath,Rock,Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak. catch the fastest train around nine. Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache. before it takes me away from my mind. Send me love and I may let you see me. Send me hopes that can spin in my head. But if you really want me to answer. I can only let you know when I'm dead. When sadness fills my days. It's time to turn away. and then tomorrow's dreams. become reality to me. So realize I'm much better without you. You're not the one and only thing in my heart. I'll just go back to pretending I'm living. so this time I'm gonna have to depart.
3395,Black Sabbath,Rock,I am the world that hides the universal. Secret of all time. Destruction of the empty spaces is my. One and only crime. I've lived a thousand times. I found out what it means to be believed. The thoughts and images. The unborn child who never was conceived. When little worlds collide. I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell. And flashing memories. Are cast into the never ending well. The name that scorns the face. The child that never sees the cause of man. The deathly darkness that. Belies the face of those who never ran. You gotta believe me. I'm talking to you. Well I know its hard for you to know the reason why. And I know you'll understand when it's time to die. Don't believe the life you have will be the only one. You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on. I want you to listen. I'm trying to get through. Love has given life to you and now its your concern. Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return. Still I look but not to touch. The seeds of life are sown. Curtain of the future falls. The secret stays unknown. Just remember love is life. And hate is living death. Treat your life for what its worth. And live for every breath. Looking back I've lived and learned. But now I'm wondering. Here I wait and only guess. What this next life will bring. Ha Ha!!

3397,Black Sabbath,Rock,What do you say to the dead. Will you forgive me for living. Can't believe the things that they said. Wonderful day for a killing. It's killing me. What do they do with your soul. Is it just lying there busted. When did you lose all control. Is there someone to be trusted. With my mind. Oh there's insufficient evidence. Of what just might come after. But sometimes out of nowhere. There's demented sounds of laughter. Are we all haunted by. The ghost - imagination. It just can't be. I've seen them there. Howling at the moon. Is it just me. Or does somebody else believe this. Well I'm not alone. And I'm not afraid. There's just one way to see. Chorus:. After all etc.. What do you say to the dead. Is there a place where it's burning. It says in a book I once read. Yes there's a chance of returning. Turn to me. The fundamental principles. Say nothing of forever. But those are voices that I hear. Or I'm just not so clever. It can't be me. I know somebody else believes this. Well I'm not alone. I'm not afraid. Just one way to see. After all etc..

Cross it out. Whenever you don't behave. Someone got the doctor. He knows what to do. Throw some bones and mumble. The devil's inside of you. It might be contagious. It might change the plan. Get back in your tiny boxes. Even if you can't. We say you can. Join the congregation. Everybody's got to get in line and. We never justify. The choir sings a never-ending lie. Pre-chorus:. When you thought you were free. You didn't need a reason. No reason to survive. Chorus:. As the big door closes. And you waiting for the nail. Somebody tell the world. You're buried alive. Once upon a nightmare. Once upon a time. You're running from tomorrow. You got lost. And found that another. Day has turned to ashes. Taken by the wind. Frozen seeds of sorrow. Never to begin. Join the celebration. And everybody's got to get in line and. We never justify. The choir sings a never-ending lie. Pre-chorus:. When you thought you were free. You did not need a reason. No reason to survive. Chorus:. As the big door closes. And you waiting for the mail. Somebody tell the world. You're buried alive. One more nightmare. Just one more time. Join the congregation. Everybody get in line. Celebration. The choir sings a lie. As you call. The hammer falls. And no one hears you cry. I'm buried alive.

3409,Black Sabbath,Rock,Dark side of love. Promise my all (?). Now that you're gone. I'm broken apart. I'll take my place. The dark side of love. Gave you my heart. You warmed my soul. How can I?. That's it my fate. Destiny call. The dark side of love. It's taking it's call. Making my heart. Losing control. I'll make my way. Alone in the cold. On the dark side of love. Dark side of love. Deep in the pain. Shadows again. Setting my soul. Darkness way. The dark side of love. It's making it's call. Making my heart. Losing control. I'll make my way. Alone in the cold. On the dark side of love. On the dark side of love. The dark side of love. It's making it's call. Making my heart. Losing control. I'll make my way. Alone in the cold. On the dark side of love

3411,Black Sabbath,Rock,Hello can you hear me. I might not be alone. Don't see anyone near me. But I just might go home again. Lets meet in the morning. I just can't speak tonight. This is more than a warning. Be silent till its light and then. You know I'll be there. Waiting for someone to believe me. Remembering it all. Make my flesh start to crawl. I've seen an ear in the wall. This time it could prove it. But you've heard this all before. Cry wolf and you're moving. To a special kind of danger zone. I need a witness. Somebody just like you. So bring an exorcist. A wizard and the Holy Ghost. You know I'll be there. Waiting for someone to believe me. Remembering it all. Make my flesh creep and crawl. I've seen an ear in the wall. One more reason one more time. Someone's walking through my mind. Now where am I suppose to go. Its not who you are its who you know. What's it gonna be. I knew you would answer. I'm the curiosity. You could miss a chance because. The fool might see reality. There it is in the corner. You must be going blind. What's wrong were you born before. Your god invented eyes. It's got to be there. Grinding away at my secrets. It's going so dark. And you can't see it all. I'll turn on some lights. So you're sure not to fall. It's next to the eye in the wall
3412,Black Sabbath,Rock,In the days of confusion. You've turned angry and cold. You say it's an ilusion. There's no fire in your soul. Say you don't love me. Say you don't care. But don't leave me standing here. Your heart's like a wheel. Just waiting to roll. It's longing for freedom. To get out on the road. You're hungry for something. That you may never find. So many reasons. Your love has made you blind. You say you don't love me. You say you don't care. So don't leave me standing here. Don't leave me standing here. You say you don't love me. You say you don't care. Don't leave me. Don't leave me standing here. Life ain't been easy. Full of passion and pain. Told me no reason. Why I was to blame. Don't leave me standing. Don't leave me standing. Don't leave me standing. On my own
3413,Black Sabbath,Rock,Take me to the river baby drink my wine. When I'm going down won't you throw me a line. Lead me to religion take me up them stairs. When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers. When will you show me a sign. When will you throw me a line. Help me to the answer baby set me free. I'm torn between the devil and the deep blue sea. Maybe if you wanted you could save my face. Keep me out of trouble and I'm a living disgrace. Show me to a sucker and you'll see my name. Standing in a line with the shadows of fame. Lead me to a legend take me up them stairs. When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers.

3415,Black Sabbath,Rock,Just before you die. They say you see your life go flashing by. Cold dark endless nights. To burn in hell or bathe in everlight. Well I don't wanna live forever. But I don't want to die. I may be dreaming or whatever. I live inside a lie!. Days pass by too soon. Waiting for the rising of the moon. No escape from here. Facing death but is your conscious clear?. I may be dreaming or whatever. Watching my lige go by. And I don't wanna live forever. But I don't wanna die!. And I don't wanna live forever. But I don't wanna die. I may be dreaming or whatever. I live inside a lie
3416,Black Sabbath,Rock,You're searching for your mind don't know where to start. Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart. You think you know but you are never quite sure. Your soul is ill but you will not find a cure.. Your world was made for you by someone above. But you choose evil ways instead of love.. You made me master of the world where you exist. The soul I took from you was not even missed.. Lord of this world. Evil possessor. Lord of this world. He's your confessor now!. You think you're innocent you've nothing to fear. You don't know me you say but isn't it clear?. You turn to me in all your worldly greed and pride.. But will you turn to me when it's your turn to die?.

3420,Black Sabbath,Rock,Feel so good I feel so fine. Love that little lady always on my mind. She gives me lovin' every night and day. Never gonna leave her. Never going away. Someone to love me. You know she makes me feel alright. Someone who needs me. Love me every single night. Feel so happy since I met that girl. When we're making love. It's something out of this world. Feels so good to know that she's all mine. Going to love that woman till the end of time. Someone to live for. Love me till the end of time. Makes me feel happy. Good to know that she's all mine. Lovely lady make love all night long. Lovely lady never do me no wrong. I don't wanna leave ya. I never wanna leave ya. Anymore no more. Lovely lady. Mystifying eyes. Lovely lady. She don't tell me no lies. I know I'll never leave ya. I'm never gonna leave ya. Anymore no more.
3421,Black Sabbath,Rock,There's a vision in the sands. Rising from the ancient past. Crying let my spirit go. Lead my burning soul to rest. Hear the sound of distant ages. It's the call of the seventh start. There's no shelter from the heat. There's no mercy from this land. Hear a thousand chanting souls. Waiting judgement from God's hand. Hear the sound of distant ages. It's the call of the seventh start. Hear the sound of fallen angels. It's the call of the seventh start. The pyramids will fall. Turn to dust before the sun. And the star will rise again. Until destiny is done. Hear the sound of distant ages. It's the call of the seventh start. Hear the sound of fallen angels. It's the call of the seventh start
3422,Black Sabbath,Rock,I am the crazy man. Who lives inside your head. But I think I'm breaking through the wall. You are the innocent. Convicted of the crime. No one was ever there. To catch you when you fall. I see the diamonds. But you only see the rock. I need to run. But you only crawl. It's time to open up. All the doors that you keep locked. Nobody gives without a take. Let's take it all. Chorus:. You've been twisted into pieces. By the hands of your emotions. How much longer are you gonna pay. For yesterday. Sins of the father. One more crucifixion. One more cross to bear. You're a hole in a photograph. Go on - lose it in the city. The city can feel no shame. See the world with electric eye. They call it mystery. But any fool could see. You thought he walked on the water. And if the pain was gone. And you were free to run away. And get out. Would you get out of there. Or do you really care. It's not safe or easy. And maybe when you're gone. You just won't belong at all. Chorus:. You're the only witness. To the murder of an angel. How much longer are you gonna pay. For yesterday. Sins of the father. It's just another crucifixion. One more cross to bear. Go on lose it in the city. Take a look at the world. You've got electric eyes.

3424,Black Sabbath,Rock,Take these bones. My spirit doesn't need them any longer. In the zone. Between the living and the dead. Take these eyes. 'Cause I don't need to see another minute. Of this life. From which I'm hanging by a thread. Please let go. We'll maybe meet again in someone's vision. Who could know. If there's another one out there?. On my own. I'm crossing through the final resolution. Going home. Without a promise or a breath. We are of indecision. Too late to change your mind. Was it a superstition?. Your dime. In my time. I've tried but didn't find a real direction. Toe the line. On the periphery of life. Say goodbye. There's no escape from absolute conclusion. Life goes by. But memories remain the same. Remain the same
3425,Black Sabbath,Rock,Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak. catch the fastest train around nine. Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache. before it takes me away from my mind. Send me love and I may let you see me. Send me hopes that can spin in my head. But if you really want me to answer. I can only let you know when I'm dead. When sadness fills my days. It's time to turn away. and then tomorrow's dreams. become reality to me. So realize I'm much better without you. You're not the one and only thing in my heart. I'll just go back to pretending I'm living. so this time I'm gonna have to depart.
3426,Black Sabbath,Rock,She came from the past. She was never meant to last. Her destiny was fatal. From the start. A messenger from hell. She cast a deadly spell. On all of those who dare. To cross her heart. Ain't no use in you trying to run. Fate has taken it's toll. Just one look and the damage is done. Burn your eyes. Turn your heart into stone. History foretold of a circle. Cast in gold. An evil seed of power. Sealed within. But fate has lent a hand. Destroyed the golden band. And freed her soul. To wash the land with sin. Ain't no use in you trying to run. Fate has taken it's toll. Just one look and the damage is done. Burn your eyes. Turn your heart into stone. She cast a deadly spell. She put a spell on you. She's got evil in her heart. Turn your heart into stone. Turn your heart into stone.
3427,Black Sabbath,Rock,Witches gather at black masses. Bodies burning in red ashes. On the hill the church in ruin. Is the scene of evil doings. It's a place for all bad sinners. Watch them eating dead rats' innards. I guess it's the same wherever you may go. Oh Lord yeah. Carry banners which denounce the lord. See me rocking in my grave. See them anoint my head with dead rat's blood. See them stick the stake through me. Oh. Don't hold me back cause I've just gotta go. They've got a hold of my soul now. Lords got my brain instinct with blood obscene. Look in my eyes I'm there enough. Yeah. On the scene a priest appears. Sinners falling at his knees. Satan sends out funeral pyre. Casts the priest into the fire. It's the place for all bad sinners. Watch them eating dead rats' innards. I guess it's the same wherever you may go. Oh Lord yeah
3428,Black Sabbath,Rock,Now the first day that I met ya. I was looking in the sky. When the sun turned all a blur. And the thunderclouds rolled by. The sea began to shiver. And the wind began to moan. It must've been a sign for me. To leave you well alone. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. You never said you love me. And I don't believe you can. 'cause I saw you in a dream. And you were with another man. You looked so cool and casual. And I tried to look the same. But now i've got to know ya. Tell me who am I to blame?. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. Now the whole wide world is movin'. 'cause there's iron in my heart. I just can't keep from cryin'. 'cause you say we've got to part. Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone. And watch you slowly take away. A love i've never known. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. Just a lit bit to strong
3429,Black Sabbath,Rock,Yes I know the secret. That's within your mind. You think all the people. Who worship you are blind. You're just like Big Brother. Giving us your trust. And when you have played enough. You'll just cast our souls. Into the dust. Into the dust. You thought that it would be easy. from the very start. Now I've found you out. I don't think you're so smart. I only have one more question. Before my time is through. Please I beg you tell me. In the name of hell. Who are you?. Who are you?.
3430,Black Sabbath,Rock,The world today is such a wicked place. Fighting going on between the human race. People give good wishes to all their friends. While people just across the sea are counting the dead. A politician's job they say is very high. For he has to choose who's got to go and die. They can put a man on the moon quite easy. while people here on earth are dying of old diseases. A woman goes to work every day after day. She just goes to work just to earn her pay. Child sitting crying by a life that's harder. he doesn't even know who is his father
3431,Black Sabbath,Rock,Astral engines in reverse. I'm falling through the universe again. Down among a dead mans vision. Faded dreams and nuclear fissions span. The strings of fear they are holding up the race. The puppets falling to the ground. The love I feel. As I fly endlessly through space. Lost in time. I wonder will my ship be found. On this sinking ship I travel. Faster than the speed of life. Not so super nova burns. The black holes turn and fade from sight. The strings of fear they hide within the human race. The answers burried underground. The love I feel. As I fly endlessly through space. Lost in time. I wonder will my ship be found. And very soon. The boundless moon. Will show us light. And as we crash. We'll pray and kiss. And say goodnight. Goodnight
3432,Blessthefall,Rock,Where'd you go. Forgive me for asking. No one knows. So tell me where you've been. Well I'm sorry for thinking. This isn't the end. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed. Swallow the words. On the tip of your tongue. Cause we don't need them. You think you'll get the best of me. We'll see. I need the anger. I need the rage. I need the worst things you can say. If you wanted a war I guess you. Got what you came for. Give me an answer. Another way I can bend and never break. If I wanted your help. I'd tell you to bite your tongue. But it's too late. I'm betting your next decision. Could be your biggest mistake. I guess you get what you pay for. I bet it's not what you think. So here we go. Another perfect disaster. Write this down. Another line in a song. I hope for your sake. You can hear me. Cause we both need this. I need the anger. I need the rage. I need the worst things you can say. If you wanted a war I guess you. Got what you came for. Give me an answer. Another way I can bend and never break. If I wanted your help. I'd tell you to bite your tongue. But it's too late. You'll try and you'll fail. I'll be the one that prevails. You'll try and you'll fail. I'll be the one that prevails. I need the anger. I need the rage. I need the worst things you can say. If you wanted a war I guess you. Got what you came for. I need the anger. I need the rage. I need the worst things you can say. If you wanted a war I guess you. Got what you came for. Give me an answer. Another way I can bend and never break. If I wanted your help. I'd tell you to bite your tongue. But it's too late
3433,Blessthefall,Rock,Just remember to forget me. I hate this honestly. Please take this the wrong way. Dont need you to need me. I need you to disappear. Cause I carry ghosts. Of the things youve said. But you wont come home. Even if youre dead. Night after night. Sleepless in Phoenix. Tell me a lie. Make me believe it. You got me right where you haunt me. Night after night. Need you to know this. Tears me apart. I hope that youre hopeless too. Your pieces are right here. But nothing really fits. I want you to want me. Then watch me disappear. Cause I carry ghosts of the things you said. I lay my bones to rest. I know. We can kiss the past goodbye
3434,Blessthefall,Rock,Dead!. We're not dead. We're not like you said. We're not dead. We're not where you said. We're not dead. We're not like you said. We're not dead. We're not where you said. We're not dead. We're not like you said. We're not dead. We're not like you!. Dead!. We're not dead. We're not like you said. We're not dead. We're not where you said. We're not dead.

We're not like you!
3435,Blessthefall,Rock,How will I find the strength?. To make it out when you're pulling me under. How can I make them see?. You're so worthless to me. Recognize what lies before me. I will stare death in the face. Recognize what lies before me. I'll stand against the waves. So talk all you want. You can't see us. But we're at the top now. Never lost our way. Can't break our stride. You don't have what it takes. We hold our own. On our own. Still undefeated. I know it's hard to stay true. With vultures pulling at you. But if it's all the same. They'll find the worst in you. If we can take what we know. And give them somewhere to go. So if it's all the same. They'll find the worst in you. I won't be used. I refuse to be. I refuse to be misled. All the bullshit I've been fed. You're worthless to me. Don't count us out. The more you push only fuels the fire. We've paid the price. We're taking back. What you took away. We hold our own. On our own. Still undefeated. I know it's hard to stay true. With vultures pulling at you. But if it's all the same. They'll find the worst in you. If we can take what we know. And give them somewhere to go. So if it's all the same. They'll find the worst in you. Nothing can last forever. I won't let you tell me how to live my life. You can't control me. I won't let you tell me how to live my life. You'll never bring me down. I know it's hard to stay true. With vultures pulling at you. But if it's all the same. They'll find the worst in you. I know it's hard to stay true. With vultures pulling at you. But if it's all the same. They'll find the worst in you. If we can take what we know. And give them somewhere to go. So if it's all the same. They'll find the worst in you. So if it's all the same. They'll find the worst in you
3436,Blessthefall,Rock,We are the saints. We are the promised ones. We're taking over. With hearts like loaded guns
3437,Blessthefall,Rock,Angels keep coming after me. Chalk outlines they captivate. Comatose concrete. Stole my hopes and dreams. It's getting hard to sink. When you're six feet deep. Am I dying?. Floating above my body. Armageddon running through my veins. I never wanted it to end this way. Dying. Floating above my body. I wish that I could numb this pain. We live and then we medicate. Hold me so close. Don't let me drift away (Don't let me drift away). My whole world slips. Right out from under me. Comatose concrete. Stole my hopes and dreams. It's getting hard to sink. When you're six feet deep. Am I dying?. Floating above my body. Armageddon running through my veins. I never wanted it to end this way. Dying. Floating above my body. I wish that I could numb this pain. We live and then we medicate. Clarity. Is missing from everything. The fear that's inside me. Pulling like tidal waves. x2. Angles keep coming after me. Chalk outline they Captivate. Am I dying?. Floating above my body. Armageddon running through my veins. I never wanted it to end this way. Dying. Floating above my body. I wish that I could numb this pain. We live and then we medicate
3438,Blessthefall,Rock,Well here go. my big plans. to build up this fortress into the clouds. it's made up of my love. and my heart and my blood. we'll make it out. Can I stand with the weight of the world? [x3]. Here I stand with the weight of the world. And this is all I've got. I'll make it now or not. It's made up of my love. I've fought so hard to fade. Our lives are meant to make. That's how it goes (it goes). I wont't fall down. my heart still pounds. I'm breathing now. I won't fall down
3439,Blessthefall,Rock,If you could stay here for just. A little bit a little while a little bit with me. Your what makes me. And if god could keep you with me. I'd trade just about anything. Your what makes me want to change things. I would die just to live and yet we all live to die. Your what makes me want to change. You will not die. You will not die. You will not die. You will not die. If you could stay here for just. A little bit a little while a little bit with me. Your what makes me. And if God could keep you with me. I'd trade just about anything.

I never had the chance -to explain myself. I never had.... You will not die. You will not die. You will not die. You will not die

I try to tell myself. That I'll see you again. Try to understand. Why I still pretend. So I lie awake. Waiting for the day. You'll need me. The times we had. The moment's passed. I try to tell myself. That I'll see you again. Try to understand. Why I still pretend. I try to tell myself. That I'll see you again. Try to understand. Why I still pretend. So I lie awake.

We've come so far. To let this slip away. And I can't let go. Of what you've done. We've tried so hard. We've prayed for better days. Please don't let go. Don't let this slip away. I just want you to know. If we're going down. We all go down together. And thats the way it is. And I know. We'll stay like this forever. I'm standing here. I'm standing by your side.

3445,Boogarins,Rock,Menina perdida no céu azul. Muito moderna fugiu pro sul. Ela caiu do céu. Miss lisergia de 69'. No ano não se apaixonou. Por nenhum rapaz. Lucifernandis das cordilheiras. Deu-me os livros. Me abriu a cabeça. Lucifernandis lá do sul
3446,Boogarins,Rock,É como ir de encontro ao outro e deixar bater. Se arrebentar sem doer. É como entrar em meio ao fogo só pra derreter. Se entregar sem querer
3447,Boogarins,Rock,Instrumental
3448,Boogarins,Rock,Três dias e noite andei. Larguei a sorte. Morte a dentro mergulhei. Me refiz forte. Pra trás nunca mais olhei. Rumei ao norte. Só agora descobri a falta das notas que nunca ouvi. Que soam como um corte. Um corte em mim. Eu vivo entre o sonho. A morte. O fim. Eu nunca mais fui eu. Eu nunca mais lembrei de mim. O mundo se esqueceu. Eu não sei mais o que é sentir. O que escuto é forte. É como um corte. Um corte em mim
3449,Boogarins,Rock,A maior demonstração. De propagação do ser é o eco. Com ele meu grito tem força. Pra derrubar todos os prédios. Que não me deixam ver o sol. Eles não deixam eu ver o sol. Que não me deixam ver o sol. E eles não deixam eu ver o sol. Que não me deixam ver o sol. Eles não deixam eu ver o sol. Que não me deixam ver o sol. Pra me prender nesse labirinto de tédio
3450,Boogarins,Rock,6000 dias. Muitos meses. Muitas horas. Sem parar. Sem. Na iminência do pensamento. Pois o momento é quem vai falar. Mas eles dizem só não sei se demais. Sem saber. Sem saber que o que importa pra mim é ser. Não ter
3451,Boogarins,Rock,Instrumental
3452,Boogarins,Rock,Você já não vê cor. Você não olha nos olhos. E quando olha é só pra mentir. Quer discutir valor. Mas você é como os porcos. Faz revolta só pra subir. Atendem por nomes. Mas no fim são todos iguais. Esbarram nas ordens. E isso os machuca demais. Sustentam a morte. E o resto é pra enfeitar. Só boto fé no som. E eu sei que o inferno é viver. O céu nunca vi. Não acredito em dom. E tudo é tão transitório. Só fazer comprova existir
3453,Boogarins,Rock,Eu vou além. Sem me importar. Com ninguém. Eu vou. E quem não vem. Já que não quer enxergar. O que não tem. Eu vou além. Sem me importar. Com ninguém. Eu vou. E quem não vem. Já não quer enxergar. O que não tem. Eu vou além. Sem me importar. Com ninguém
3454,Boogarins,Rock,Is it evil if?. I was complete in a pursuit of the flesh. You saw medusa knew that you were a myth. A gaze that paralyzes my eyes. It's a seed kept?. Your circles let you just proceed and accept. You saw the future came and jockeyed for debt. It's just a peryl repeated on. Is it evil if. Your circles let you just proceed and accept. You saw the future came and jockeyed for debrt. It's just a peryl repeated on
3455,Boogarins,Rock,Todos os mitos dos beatles. Se o Paul ainda fosse vivo. Com certeza ele iria entregar. Pois sempre tem um careta. Que não abre a cabeça. E solta merda ao invés de falar. O tempo passou e você quer ser alguém. Mas nada mudou e você não sabe quem. Não é para ser o mais louco. Mas apenas um pouco. Só o bastante para não chatear. Pois sempre tem um careta. Que não abre a cabeça. E me segura quando vou voar. O tempo passou e você que ser alguém. Mas nada mudou e você não sabe quem. O tempo passou e você quer ser alguém. Mas nada mudou e você não sabe quem

3468,Cazuza,Rock,Eu tô perdido. Sem pai nem mãe. Bem na porta da tua casa. Eu tô pedindo. A tua mão. E um pouquinho do braço. Migalhas dormidas do teu pão. Raspas e restos. Me interessam. Pequenas porções de ilusão. Mentiras sinceras me interessam. Me interessam.... Eu tô pedindo. A tua mão. Me leve para qualquer lado. Só um pouquinho. De proteção. A um maior abandonado. Seu corpo com amor ou não. Raspas e restos me interessam. Me ame como a um irmão. Mentiras sinceras me interessam. Me interessam.... Migalhas dormidas do teu pão. Raspas e restos me interessam. Pequenas poções de ilusão. Mentiras sinceras me interessam. Me interessam.... Eu tô pedindo. Que a tua mão. Me leve para qualquer lado. Só um pouquinho de proteção. A um maior abandonado
3469,Cazuza,Rock,Passeando outro dia. Meus rayban escuros. Eu conheci um andróide. Sem par nem futuro. Porque também não existe mais nenhum futuro. Não tem sonho nenhum. Ele nada espera. Por isso nem repara. A manha do poeta. Porque também não existe nenhuma saudade. Não. Não existe maldade. Na terra do andróide sem par. (Refrão). Uns viram Messias e andam no mar. Uns andam armados pra te matar. Fazem amor por esporte. Vivem a vida. Não pensam na morte. Não tem sonho nenhum. Ele nada espera. Por isso nem repara. A manha do poeta. Porque também não existe nenhuma saudade. Não. Não existe maldade. Na terra do andróide sem par. (Refrão). Uns viram Messias e andam no mar. Uns andam armados pra te matar. Fazem amor por esporte. Vivem a vida. Não pensam na morte
3470,Cazuza,Rock,Era assim. O homem que me ensinava a natureza. Eu ia em suas costas menino. Sentia o suor quente em suas costas. E uma alegria sem sentido. Depois veia a mata grossa. Onde a morte brincava de perigo. Éramos nós dois e uma trilha no mato. E a tal floresta que não era. Me ensinou o nome dos pássaros. E o impossível do vôo. Depois veio a praia sem segredos. E um poema que veio na hora. Era assim:. O homem me ensinava a natureza. Da mulher e do que ela espera:. Um homem que a proteja. E pague seu amor. Um homem que a maltrate. E viva do seu amor. Um homem simplesmente. Que lhe inche a barriga. E que a mulher é o demônio. Disfarçado de anjo. E que é preciso tomar muito cuidado. Porque são belas dissimuladas. Falou dos homens com são ingênuos. Com suas brincadeiras de guerra. De como são a massa crua. E a mulher a folheada. Era assim:. O homem me ensinava a natureza. E eu ia em suas costas menino. by Jordana Bonasina
3471,Cazuza,Rock,Exausto. De correr sabendo. Que não tem ponto de chegada. Nem beijo de namorada. O ar entra e sai. O mar vem e vai. Você nada. Assopra que passa. Fala que esquece. Chora que molha. Martelada no dedo. Por exemplo. Teu rosto. Meu posto de observação solitária. Meu gosto pelo amargo. Pelo que arde. Nem canto nem berro surdo. Nem lamento. O lobo uiva. Pra se mostrar pra Deus. São frias e distantes. Terras por onde te passeio. A peito nu. Dói.... by Jordana Bonasina
3472,Cazuza,Rock,Cavalos Calados. Cazuza. Composição: Raul Seixas. O termômetro registrou. A enfermeira confirmou. E o padre encomendou. A minha morte aparente. A minha sorte. Minha camisa rasgada. No peito correndo óleo diesel. O relógio alarmou. A TV anunciou. O hotel todo pirou. Na minha morte preto e branca. A sua sorte. E o seu durex já não cola. Já não basta o tapa-olho. Meu pulso não pulsou. O aparelho aceitou. E o médico pirou. A minha morte aparente. A sua sorte. Minha garganta sem voz. E a minha morte veloz. O termômetro registrou. O aparelho aceitou. A enfermeira confirmou. E o padre encomendou. . Meu corpo tem 2 mil cavalos calados...

Se alguém me ama. Ela diz que não. Se nem me notam. Ela diz: """"Por que não?"""". É a minha companheira inseparável. Sua fidelidade é incomparável. E me perdoa por não ter razão. A minha culpa de estimação. E me aceita o pior dos tarados. Um ser mesquinho tropeçando no nada. Guarda segredo e diz que não é chantagem. Que ninguém vai saber das minhas bobagens. Me dá um calmante e diz que é pra eu ser bom. A minha culpa de estimação. (Ela é de estimação). Me dá um calmante e diz que é pra eu ser bom. A minha culpa de estimação. (Ela é de estimação).

3474,Cazuza,Rock,Todo dia. Em qualquer lugar. Eu te encontro mesmo sem estar. O amor da gente é pra reparar. Nos recados que quem ama dá. Se o planeta só quer rodar. Nesse eixo em que a gente está. O amor da gente é pra se guardar. Com cuidado pra ele não quebrar. Hoje é o dia dos namorados. Dos perdidos e dos achados. É o dia dos namorados. Dos perdidos e dos achados. Todo mundo planeja amar. Banho quente ou tempestade polar. O amor da gente é pra temperar. As forças que a natureza dá. Hoje é o dia dos namorados. Dos perdidos e dos achados. É o dia dos namorados. Dos perdidos e dos achados. Diz que que a era é pra sonhar. Que na terra é só simplificar. O amor da gente é pra continuar. E a nossa força não vai parar. Hoje é o dia dos namorados. Dos perdidos e dos achados. É o dia dos namorados. Dos perdidos e dos achados. Hoje é o dia dos namorados. Dos perdidos e dos achados
3475,Cazuza,Rock,Você me quer?. Você cuida de mim?. Mesmo que eu seja uma pessoa egoísta e ruim?. Você me aceita. E me dá a receita. De como conviver com um monstro mesquinho e careta?. Você me respeita. Não grita comigo. Mesmo que eu tente tudo pra te irritar. Você tem que entender. Que eu sou filho único. Que os filhos únicos são seres infelizes. Eu tento mudar. Eu tento provar que me importo com os outros. Mas é tudo mentira (tudo mentira). Estou na mais completa solidão. Do ser que é amado e não ama. Me ajude a conhecer a verdade. A respeitar meus irmãos. E a amar quem me ama

3477,Cazuza,Rock,Sempre só. Eu vivo procurando alguem que sofra como eu... também. Mas não consigo achar ninguém. Sempre só. A vida vai seguindo assim. não tenho quem tem dó de mim. A luz negra de um destino cruel. Ilumina um teatro sem cor. Onde estou representando o papel. Do palhaço do amor.

3479,Cazuza,Rock,Por que você me olha. Com esses olhos de loucura?. Por que você diz meu nome?. Por que você me procura?. Se as nossas vidas juntas. Vão ter sempre um triste fim. Se existe um preconceito muito forte. Separando você de mim. por que esse beijo agora?. Por que meu amor este abraço?. Um dia você vai embora. Sem sofrer os tormentos que eu passo?. De que vale sonhar um minuto. Se a verdade da vida é muito ruim. Se existe um preconceito muito forte. Separando você de mim
3480,Cazuza,Rock,Segunda-feira:. Criar a partir do feio. Enfeitar o feio. Até o feio seduzir o belo. Terça-feira:. Evitar mentiras meigas. Enfrentar taras obscuras. Amar de pau duro. Quarta-feira:. Magia acima de tudo. Drogas barbitúricos. I Ching. Seitas macabras. O irracional como aceitação do universo. Quinta-feira:. Olhar o mundo. Com a coragem do cego. Ler da tua boca as palavras. Com a atenção do surdo. Falar com os olhos e as mãos. Como fazem os mudos. Sexta-feira:. Assunto de família:. Melhor fazer as malas. E procurar uma nova. (Só as mães são felizes). Sábado:. Não adianta desperdiçar sofrimento. Por quem não merece. É como escrever poemas no papel higiênico. E limpar o cu. Com os sentimentos mais nobres. Domingo:. Não pisar em falso. Nem nos formigueiros de domingo. Amar ensina a não ser só. Só fogos de São João no céu sem lua. Mas reparar e não pisar em falso. Nem nas moitas do metrô nos muros. E esquinas sacanas comendo a rua. Porque amar ensina a ser só. Lamente longe por favor. Chore sem fazer barulho
3481,Cazuza,Rock,"""Você nunca varou. A Duvivier as 5. Nem levou um susto saindo do Val improviso. Era quase meio-dia. No lado escuro da vida. Nunca viu Lou Reed. """"Walking on the Wild Side"""". Nem Melodia transvirado. Rezando pelo Estácio. Nunca viu Allen Ginsberg. Pagando michê na Alaska. Nem Rimbaud pelas tantas. Negociando escravas brancas. Você nunca ouviu falar em maldição. Nunca viu um milagre. Nunca chorou sozinha num banheiro sujo. Nem nunca quis ver a face de Deus. Já frequentei grandes festas. Nos endereços mais quentes. Tomei champanhe e cicuta. Com comentários inteligentes. Mais tristes que os de uma puta. No Barbarella as 15 pras 7. Você Já Reparou como os velhos. Vão perdendo a esperança. Com seus bichinhos de estimação e plantas?. Já viveram tudo. E sabem que a vida é bela. Você Reparou na inocência. Cruel das criancinhas. Com seus comentários desconcertantes?. Elas Adivinham tudo. E sabem que a vida é bela. Você nunca sonhou. Ser currada por animais. Nem transou com cadáveres?. Nunca traiu teu melhor amigo. Nem quis comer a tua mãe?. Só as mães são felizes. Não podem mudar a vida"""
3482,Cazuza,Rock,Um homem pode se afobar. E pegar o caminho errado. Homem que é homem volta atrás. Mas não se arrepende de nada. Sabe que a vida é pra lutar. Contra um dragão invisível. Que mata os sonhos mais banais. Que acha que é tudo impossível. Um homem que veio do pó. É o que transforma o pó em ouro. Um homem foi criado só. Mas vive em função do outro. Na natureza onde ele é rei. No universo onde não é nada. Na incerteza e no prazer. Na ilusão de ser amado. Tudo é amor. Mesmo se for por carma. Tudo é amor. Pretensão descarada. Um homem nasce pra cagar. Nas regras desse paraíso. Um homem deve procurar. A fruta que foi proibida. No meio dessa multidão. Na escuridão e na agonia. Poder chamar alguém de irmão. E ter um sono bem tranqüilo. Tudo é amor. Mesmo se for por carma. Tudo é amor. Pretensão descarada. Um homem nasce pra brincar. E não pra esculhambar a vida. Um homem nasce pra curar. E cutucar a ferida. Mesmo se for pra transformar. Num inferno um céu conformista. Mesmo se for pra guerrear. Escolha as armas mais bonitas. . . By_Ni

O que te diz mais?. O que te diz mais?

3498,Charlie Brown Jr,Rock,Pare o que está fazendo agora. grite alto e jogue tudo pra fora. hoje é dia de celebrar. o quanto falta pra essa porra de mundo acabar. Seja dono do seu pensamento. a felicidade está em cada momento. seja dono de sua cabeça. mas saiba o que dizer. para falar o que pensa. Você corre e corre. ninguém entende você. sua vida está na mão dos homens do poder. papa papapapa. papa papapapa. papa papapapa. Pra mim uma rima louca tipo o qual aprendizado. que muda todo o quadro. e deixa o povo ligado. que a vida cobra muito sério e você não vai fingir. não pode se esconder e não deve se iludir. Somos herdeiros da evolução. mas se o mundo é tão desumano. será essa ilusão a nossa herança. Não somos problemas sem solução. mas se o mundo é tão desumano. será essa ilusão a nossa herança
3499,Charlie Brown Jr,Rock,O mundo explodiu lá fora. A vida não é mais como devia ser. O futuro é aqui agora. Você sorri mais uma noite mesmo sem saber. Pra onde vai esse mundo hostil. Vivo pra acreditar que um dia a vida vai mudar. Mas realmente é muito difícil. Uma visão otimista do mundo em que vivo. Vendo várias pessoas no lixo. Voltamos a viver como bichos. Voltamos ao início do fanatismo ao sacrifício. Síndrome da dúvida absoluta. Um bom guerreiro. Não foge à luta!. . (postado por Jeh)

3505,Circus Rock,Rock,Te ver todo dia nunca é demais. Não canso de você minha felicidade você traz. Qualquer momento vale a pena. O dia todo passa rápido ao teu lado se desfaz. Dia após dia me vício em você. Se não tentar te encontrar o desespero bate e a tristeza. não vou deixar acabar. Qualquer segundo de você. não importa o tempo sempre vai valer. Não não não eu vou lutar. E não vou deixar que uma distância. ou menos tempo faça mal. So quero te dizer que nunca vou te deixar. ao teu lado sempre quero estar. Vem pra cá ou eu aí. Pra nós nos vermos e ao teu lado eu vou viver
3506,Circus Rock,Rock,Logo que nascemos jogaram sobre nós. conceitos e padrões impostos pra criar. O certo ou o errado que eu devo seguir. Por isso que temos que lutar. pra resistir tentar não ser parte do total correr. Acabamos dentro sem mesmo perceber. Ao ouvir tal heresia tentaram acabar com a minha autonomia. Entre tantos normais. Faz diferença aquele que se opõe. Não seja conivente neutro juntando-se ao total. Eu quero mais. E sou capaz. Eu quero mais. Se for capaz. Não vou permitir rever o que passei. e os mesmo erros repetirem contra quem errou. agora ao contrário que parece ideal. com outro nome não quer dizer melhor. Bandeira da igualdade pra sustentar. O grupo que se forma pra resistir. Desconstruir parece ser a resposta. Para tudo nesse meio que se vê em caos. De oprimidos a opressores. hipócritas sem mesmo entender. Construindo conceitos individuais. O mesmo erro praticam sem se tocar. Eu quero mais. E sou capaz. Eu quero mais. Se for capaz. Não vou deixar mais uma vez. Impondo algo para o outro. E o poder corrompe com falsa moral. joga o jogo pra viver. melhor as custas de outro alguém. E a bandeira da igualdade vira. Relação vertical
3507,Circus Rock,Rock,Aos pouco percebi que não posso dizer. O que eu penso o que eu acho que eu tenho que fazer. As pessoas me falam que está tudo bom. Presas num mundo omissas sem ação. O medo da mudança pode assustar. Eu digo meu amigo venha se informar. Nada é para sempre isso vai se transformar. O amanhã vai ser agora mas não posso adivinhar. Eu quero gritar o que eu achar melhor. A mudança vai vir com o respeito e liberdade. Não vou! deixar. que me impeçam de dizer. qualquer coisa que eu pensar. E eu vou! desmanchar. a ideia que o passado sempre é melhor. O medo da mudança pode assustar. Eu digo meu amigo venha se informar. Nada é para sempre isso vai se trasnformar. O amanhã vai ser agora mas não posso adivinhar. Eu quero gritar o que eu achar melhor. A mudança vai vir com o respeito e liberdade. Não vou! deixar. que me impeçam de dizer. qualquer coisa que eu pensar. E eu vou! desmanchar. a ideia que o passado sempre é melhor.
3508,Dawes,Rock,If you're just asking for a reason. Reasons are everywhere you look. The only difference between them. Are which you gave and which you took. Every smile with some dark anticipation. And dreams of back before it settled in their brows. I don't remember when you first began to notice. But I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. The latest singer's latest single's got me listening. For the pact between the writer and the star. This is how mythology is written. This is where the lawless jungles are. She's just a singer living mostly after midnight. Pumping blood and money back into a town. And it all eventually betrays her. But I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. So I guess it makes me wonder what I'm chasing. Like a dancer that's breaking in her shoes. Like sending men up to the moon just for the landing. Displaying power we don't know how else to use. Sometimes it's more than I can handle. Sometimes it's all the joy I've found. And it'll all end up on one side or the other. But I can't think about it now. The decades that are hidden in the sidewalks. The narrative that naturally occurs. The everlasting wisdom of a sports bar. The poison that's mistaken for a cure. All these backward glances putting me in danger. Of forgetting how to turn myself around. It's just that time just keeps on slipping through my fingers. But I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now
3509,Dawes,Rock,You still wear your hair to your shoulder. You still look like a friday night. You're still caught somewhere between the plans and the dreams. So that neither end up turning out right. And i myself look a few moments older. When i learned that love is not as simple as i thought. It starts to feel more real and the wounds all start to heal. Whether i want them to or not. So tell me why you think i should forgive what you did. And ill tell you if i understand. Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid. But youre now coming back to a man. . It means a lot that you came here to speak to me. And i will listen in ways i never did before. I'll hear the pause between each word and when your presentations heard. Then i'll need to show you to the door. Cause some people were just meant to be a memory.. To be called upon to remind us how we've changed. The way the scattered ever-busy bright lights of a city. Might look off to a distant mountain range. And the guy you know is someone i work hard at keeping hid. And he is very good at sticking to the plan. Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid. But youre now coming back to a man. I might think of you more often then i'm willing to admit. But i cant show every card i'm holding in my hand. Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid. But youre now coming back to a man
3510,Dawes,Rock,Stars please shine the way for me. Show the one that I have followed. To see how far I’ve come. Sun that slowly sets on me. Be the same to rise tomorrow. To see how far I’ve come. These are the days we swore upon. So barman keep the TV on. To see how far we’ve come. Peak to peak and shore to shore. This is all love was ever for. Is to see how far we’ve come. California’s greenest parts. I reach out for my brother. To see how far he’s come. For the girl that came to break my heart. I call on her new lover. To see how far she’s come. Why your mother keeps a record of her child’s height. Why we all are here tonight. Is to see how far we’ve come. The only point of clocks and maps. The only point of looking back. Is to see how far we’ve come. Ooh Ooh Oh Oh Oh…Ooh Ooh Ooh…Ooh Ooh Ooh Oh Ohhh. Ooh Ooh Oh Oh Oh…Ooh Ooh Ooh…Ooh Ooh Ooh Oh Ohhh. Stars please shine the way for me. Show the one that I have followed. To see how far I’ve come. And sun that slowly sets on me. Be the same to rise tomorrow. To see how far I’ve come
3511,Dawes,Rock,If you're just asking for a reason. Reasons are everywhere you look. The only difference between them. Are which you gave and which you took. Every smile with some dark anticipation. And dreams of back before it settled in their brows. I don't remember when you first began to notice. But I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now.

I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now
3512,Dawes,Rock,When it hits me what she's gone. I think I'll run for president. Get my face put on the million dollar bill. So when these rich men that she wants. Show her ways they can take care of her. I'll have found a way to be there with her still. When it hits me that she's gone. I think I'll be an astronaut. Make the moon my home and leave the earth behind. So when eh steps out into the night. She'll be facing me every time she shines. When it hits me that she's left me alone. When I finally move on with my life. Her goodbye written into stone. And her shadow grown into a night. When it hits me that she's gone. I think I'll be a movie star. Play the finest men the world has ever seen. So when these lovers that she's found. Show her ways they learned to talk to her. Behind each perfect word there'll be a little bit of me
3513,Dawes,Rock,A ballerina in Phoenix. The pines up north. The sunrise from a highway. That was not there before. If I can place it all together. Make out the nature of the call. I start to feel the love and the silence. That was always at the root of it all. And in my constant quest for truth. I am condemned to facts alone. And though my dreams all lead me nowhere. I won’t forget my way back home. From the corner of a coffee shop. Or from the center of a stage. From the words used in a love note. Or from an empty page. While I struggle with these beauties. And my renditions end up dry. I’m like a bird that crashes into the window. That was drawn to the reflection of the sky. And the more I try to speak. The more I lose that earthly tone. And before heaven proves me hopeless. I won’t forget my way back home. Ooh Oooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh...... I admit that these answers that I seek. Are all to questions I’ve never known. But I pray to keep on looking for as long as I can roam. And when the world finally fulfills me. I will not forget my way back home
3514,Dawes,Rock,I suppose we are born from our silence. But you seem to take yours with you. Like a child that refuses to bloom. You forced me to face all of your beauty. Then turned your beauty away from yourself. This road that we've taken doesn't seem to stop here. But doesn't seem to go anywhere else. And your heart rests in your chest. Like a charm 'round your neck. That you couldn't find words to refuse. And this high horse you ride. It has broken its stride. As it leads us through worlds built for you. So walk with me a little bit further. So I can find the tenderness you keep inside. God made you with a taste for the madness in love. But you confuse your gift with your pride. And I can't help you with removed that bandage. I will leave you all to yourself while you heal. As I'm learning time is a language. And it's the best way to explain how I feel. And while the magician you meet. Sweeps you off your feet. Saying he'll teach you tricks all for free. I'll be in the way that you laugh. As he cuts you in half. And holds you up for the crowds all to see. So forgive me for feeling so strongly. But I feel like we can finally agree. That true lovers always end up lonely. Cause they know how good it could be. I've heard the men in your wake. Describe you as a snake. As you slip away when they start to wilt. But I firmly believe. You're a lot more like Eve. As she enjoys a bit of her guilt
3515,Dawes,Rock,These days my friends don’t seem to know me. Without my suitcase in my hand. Where I am standing still. I seem to disappear. But maybe that's how I found you. Maybe that's taugh me exactly what I want. Maybe meeting you so far away from home. Is what makes it all so clear. But you got that special kind of sadness. You got that tragic set of charms [Chorus]. That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles. Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms. When people ask me where I come from. To see what that says about man. I only end up giving bad directions. That never lead them there at all. It’s something written in the head lights. Is something swimming in my drink. And if I were the moon. It would be exactly where I fall. Cause you got that special kind of sadness. You got that tragic set of charms [Chorus]. That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles. Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms. I used to think someone would love me. For places I have been. And the dirt I have been gathering. Deep beneath my nails. But now I know what I’ve been missing. And I’m going home to make it mine. And I'll be battening the hatches and pulling in the sails.. But you got that special kind of sadness. You got that tragic set of charms [Chorus] x2. That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles. Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms
3516,Dawes,Rock,To be completely honest. The picture isn't clear to me yet. You insisted that your own explanations. While I was patiently enjoying the debt. And when I think about it. I'm not even sure if I mind. You were the fading signal that would slip through the static. For a station that I never could find. So you don't need to say a word right now. All your reasons would just flicker in the darkness. Maybe that's why nobody knows how. To be completely honest. To be completely honest. It feels like you're still in the room. From the bracelets that you left on the nightstand. To the crows in the yard each afternoon. I just can't get off it (?). I haven't been sleeping at all. Some questions weave themselves into the fabric. And some are welcome tell me to call (?). But then I never know where I should start. And the record of the sit downs is all I have accomplished. I never really thought it'd be so hard. To be completely honest. To be completely honest. I think I know how it ends. The universe keeps expanding. While we discuss particulars of just being friends. And maybe that makes everything okay. Remembering the defect at the heart of every promise. Maybe that's the only way. To be completely honest (x4)
3517,Deep Purple,Rock,Nobody´s gonna take my car. I'm gonna race it to the ground. Nobody gonna beat my car. It's gonna break the speed of sound. Oooh it's a killing machine. It's got everything. Like a driving power. Big fat tires and everything. I love it. And I need it. I bleed it. Yeah it's a wild hurricane. Alright hold tight. I'm a highway star. Nobody gonna take my girl. I'm gonna keep her to the end. Nobody gonna have my girl. She stays close on every bend. Oooh she's a killing machine. She's got everything. Like a moving mouth. Body control and everything. I love her. I need her. I seed her. Yeah She turns me on. Alright hold on tight. I'm a highway star. Nobody gonna take my head. I got speed inside my brain. Nobody gonna steal my head. Now that I'm on the road again. Oooh I'm in heaven again. I've got everything. Like a moving ground. An open road and everything. I love it. I need it. I seed it. Eight cylinders all mine. Alright hold tight. I'm a highway star. Nobody gonna take my car. I'm gonna race it to the ground. Nobody gonna beat my car. It's gonna break the speed of sound. Oooh it's a killing machine. It's got everything. Like a driving power. Big fat tires and everything. I love it. And I need it. I bleed it. Yeah it's a wild hurricane. Alright hold on tight. I'm a highway star. I'm a highway star. I'm a highway star
3518,Deep Purple,Rock,Feels like the end. When you're closer to losing your dreams. Than losing a friend. Flying blind. I'm shooting into the dark. Who will I find. Oh girl. And if it takes me a lifetime. I swear I'll tear down every wall. Love conquers all. On my way. Tomorrow I rise with the sun. Soon I'll be gone. Words can't say. How the memories of feelings of love. They linger on. Oh girl. And if it takes me forever. I know it's worth every teardrop that falls. Love conquers all. Somewhere there's a place in your heart. Where the wounds never heal. Well you're not alone. That's just how I feel. Love conquers all. This one will last a lifetime. And if love conquers all. This one will last forever
3519,Deep Purple,Rock,While you were out.... The message says. You left a number. And I tried to call. But they wrote it down. In a perfect spanish scrawl. In a perfect spanish scrawl. Yet again. I'm missing you. King size bed. (in a) hotel someplace. I hear your name. I see your face. I see your face. (the) back street dolls. And the side door johnnies. The wide eyed boys with their bags full of. Money. Back in the alley. Going bang to the wall. Tied to the tail. Of a midnight crawl. Heaven wouldn't be. So high I know. If the times gone by. Hadn't been so low. The best laid plans. Come apart at the seams. And shatter all my dreams. Sometimes I feel like.... Screaming. Close my eyes. It's times like this. My head goes down. And the only thing I know. Is the name of this town. Is the name of this town. Yet again. I'm missing you. Won't be long. I'm coming home. Until that distant time. I'll be moving on. I'll be moving on
3520,Deep Purple,Rock,I hear the beating of your wings. As if you're playing on my strings. In mysterious ways. You draw me in. To a love. Beyond all understanting. Beyond my reach. So far away. But it seems. Like only yesterday. I'm haunted. Haunted. Is that what you wanted. All that's left. Is the ghost of your smile. It stays awhile. Then fades away. I hear your footsteps on the ground. Tempting me to turn around. It's just the echo. Of a disenchanted lover. Shuffling aimlessly. Homeward bound. To empty rooms. And picture frames. And friends. Who can't recall our names. I'm haunted. Haunted. Is that what you wanted. All that's left. Is the ghost of your smile. It stays a while. And fades away
3521,Deep Purple,Rock,Sweet Lucy was a dancer. But none of us would chance her. Because she was a Samurai. She made electric shadows. Beyond our fingertips. And none of us could reach that high. She came on like a teaser. I had to touch and please her. Enjoy a little paradise. The log was in my pocket. When Lucy met the Rockett. And she never knew the reason why. I can't deny it. With that smile on her face. It's not the kill. It's the thrill of the chase. Feel it coming. It's knocking at the door. You know it's no good running. It's not against the law. The point of no return. And now you know the score. And now you're learning. What's knockin' at your back door. Sweet Nancy was so fancy. To get into her pantry. Had to be the aristocracy. The members that she toyed with. At her city club. Were something in diplomacy. So we put her on the hit list. Of a common cunning linguist. A master of many tongues. And now she eases gently. From her Austin to her Bentley. Suddenly she feels so young
3522,Deep Purple,Rock,You can bury me up to my knees in shit. Or anything else... I don't mind a bit. You think I'm gonna drown but you're wrong. 'Cos man I got my hip boots on. Get your ass in the water and swim like me. It's the only way you're going free. If you blink an eye I'm down the road and gone. It's plain to see that I don't belong. I got my hip boots on. It's so cool. It's beautiful. Those rusty chains can't tie me down. 'Cos man I got my hip boots on. I never give it up. Tear it up. Rip it up. Can't get enough. Oh yeah. Before that shit starts going down. When I hear the dogs I go to ground. That's me high steppin' through the swamp. That's why I got these hip boots on. I got my hip boots on. It's so cool. It's beautiful. And it's so cool
3523,Deep Purple,Rock,"""""""Descending the cold steps of the institution. For the politically insane. Never to be seen again. Saying farewell to daylight. From henceforth I shall rot. In a stinking bed of wet straw"""". Right from the ashes of life. I learned to behave. What to believe. What not to say. From cradle to grave. Ah... Like a good little slave. Sucking my milk. From the venomous tit of the State. Clearly designed to suppress. Every thought of escape. Ah... I surrender to fate. No pity no pity. Don't want no pity for me. In this filthy cell. I see you in hell. Frozen in time. I'm a specimen pinned to my throne. With an army of butterflies. Pilloried placid and prone. Ah... We were never alone. No pity no pity. Don't no pity for me. In this filthy cell. I see you in hell. """"After centuries of living. With nothing but my convictions. Broken fingers clawing through. The walls of my incarceration. Escaping the clutches of eternal damnation. I was justified"""""""
3524,Deep Purple,Rock,The world around us hangs in doubt. You face a crime that we'll hear about. To pay the cost would never be the same. Eternal lovers we're not to blame. There's no mistake there's no refrain. The same surroundings that stood. Are here again this time. As I look around you can't be found. To lose you I'd rather see. The endless time of space go passing by. This time around. This time around. So look around we all will be found. In love. The world around us hangs in doubt. You face a crime that we'll hear about. To pay the cost would never be the same. Eternal lover you're not to blame. There's no mistake there's no refrain. The same surroundings that stood. Are here again this time. As I look around you can't be found. To lose you I'd rather see. The endless time of space go passing by. This time around. This time around. To lose you I'd rather see. The endless time of space go passing by. Fly. By
3525,Deep Purple,Rock,(Coverdale/Hughes/Lord). Called to Madonna. To give me a line. She said boy what have you done. Passing your time with a holy man. Talking about the moon and sun. But I can't tell the difference. Between the fool and wise. Show me a river to follow. Away from all these lies. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been picking up my bones too long. Won't you understand. Called to the Captain. To put me ashore. For it looked like no man's land. Is this the way to follow. I cried as I shook his hand. He told me had no answer. He didn't really hold the key. I am a simple man. Was all he said to me. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me a hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand. I've been on the road so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand. Heard my mother crying. She was calling out my name. Whisper in the dark night. Saying who's to blame. The hour glass keeps turning. With not enought sand to see. I am a holy man. So don't you bother me. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been pickin' up my bones too long. Won't you understand. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand?. .
3526,Deep Purple,Rock,(Blackmore/Gillan/Glover). don't turn off the light. you might draw the queen of spades. don't shut the door. you don't need to be alone. i won't bring you no food. there might be some poison in your meat. i've got to know are you dead or alive. don't shut the door are you dead or alive. dead or alive. pick your window you're leaving. don't look in the mirror. with a dollar up your face. you've got money to burn. you're cheap at half the price. oh don't powder your nose. don't blow your brains just for the the. crack. i've got to know are you dead or alive. just for the crack are you dead or alive. dead or alive. pick your window you're leaving. you're running so fast. but you know you're standing still. i'm afraid of your shadow. and the knife in it's hand. you're dancing with death. to the tune of the dealer. and he don't care. don't give a toss. don't want to know if. you're dead or alive. don't want to know if. you're dead or alive. dead or alive. pick your window. you're leaving.
3527,Deep Purple,Rock,Comin' out of nowhere. Drivin' like rain. Stormbringer dance. On the thunder again. Dark cloud gathering. Breaking the day. No point running. 'Cause it's coming your way. Ride the rainbow. Crack the sky. Stormbringer coming. Time to die. Got to keep running. Stormbringer coming. He's got nothing you need. He's gonna make you bleed. Rainbow shaker. On a stallion twister. Bareback rider. On the eye of the sky. Stormbringer coming down. Meaning to stay. Thunder and lightning. Heading your way. Ride the rainbow. Crack the sky. Stormbringer coming. Time to die. Got to keep running. Stormbringer coming. He's got nothing you need. He's gonna make you bleed. Coming out of nowhere. Drivin' like a-rain. Stormbringer dance. On the thunder again. Dark cloud gathering. Breaking the day. No point running. 'Cause it's coming your way.
3528,Deep Purple,Rock,Instrumental
3529,Deep Purple,Rock,John San what you can. La la Janette dance in sand. What's the mystery my son. Gypsy Dan Caravan. Won Tun Wan with your Chinese fan. It's part of history my son. Murder and rape with your power. The 10th revolution in far away days. It's come to this. A gypsy's kiss. All your power's gonna fade in the haze. Ya who' Jumme gae bile ya heed. The Senorita said. I'll drag yer lungs out through yer nose. Space truckers free and high. Teamsters get ya by and by. That should keep you on your toes. They got a gun at your head. But you ain't necessarily playing their. game. They can't resist. A Gypsy's Kiss. All that's needed to drive them insane. John Wayne The Alamo. Crazy Horse Geronimo. I'll smoke a piece with you. Mind Body Heart and Soul. We got Rock and Roll. And there's nothing they can do. Hear the small voice of truth. Above the shouting despair of the crowd. What do you wish. A Gypsy's Kiss. Gets you strong for crying out loud
3530,Deep Purple,Rock,As you watch from your house on the hill. World keeps spinning around you you're standing still. And a thought rivers enters your mind. Something happened once in my life. A fading picture of you that's so hard to describe. I've been where the sun never shines. That's alright there's a change in the story. That's alright there's a change in the plan. A twist in the tale. Face in the mirror head in the clouds. Hanging on to a dream that you can't do without. As it drops like a stone without trace. Give what you want take what you need. Squeezing so hard there's no room to breathe. And your flavour has fallen from grace. That's alright there's a change in the story. That's alright there's a change in the plan. A twist in the tale. I saw you dancing. Dancing on air. You were lost in the in the starlight. No one but me really cared. Every question turns out a lie. Can't you swallow the truth for once in your life. I loved you but don't ask me why. It's alright there's a change in the story. It's alright there's a change in the plan. A twist in the tale.
3531,Deep Purple,Rock,(Verse). Light turn the candle. I spark one for me. Let it float on the water. Right down to the sea. You draw back your curtain. A wavy goodbye. Lift up your arms. And look up to the sky. To the sky!. (Verse). Stop me a candle. And keep it in the light. Thought it pairing window. And I come back tonight. You touch me in the darkness. I send you a sign. A give me your loving. And I'll give you mine. (Chorus). I'm maybe leaving. But I won't be gone. I'll be there when you want me. Above and beyond. (Verse). You're fading like I tell you. It's all up to you. I'll be there if you'll need me. If I get it through. Reached on your settlers. And tomorrow you'll find. Your souls had been touched. Are forever entwined. (Chorus). I'm maybe leaving. But I won't be gone. I'll be there when you want me. Above and beyond. (Chorus 2). Yes I'm maybe leaving. But not for too long. I'll be there when you want me. Above and beyond
3532,Deep Purple,Rock,When the night wind softly blows through my open window. Then I start to remember the girl that brought me joy. Now the night wind softly blows sadness to tomorrow. Bringing tears to eyes so tired. Eyes I thought could cry no more. If the day would only come. Then you might just appear. even though you'd soon be gone. When I reached out my hand. If I could see you. If only I could see you. To see if you are laughing or crying. When the night winds softly blow. In my dark and whispering room. Memories still bring me a numbness to my feelings. Take my hand and brush my brow. In the warm and fevered dark. Heart is madly beating. My crazy thoughts are burning. When the night winds softly blow. If the day would only come. Then you might just appear. even though you'd soon be gone. When I reached out my hand. If I could see you. If only I could see you. To see if you are laughing or crying. When the night winds softly blow. If the day would only come. Then you might just appear. even though you'd soon be gone. When I reached out my hand. If I could see you. If only I could see you. To see if you are laughing or crying. When the night winds softly blow
3533,Deep Purple,Rock,I'm so far away. From everything you know. Your name is carried on the wind. Your ice blue waters Anya. Where do they flow. Where have they been. Where have they been. A hidden passion. Touching a spark. Flame of revolution. Burning wild in your gypsy heart. Your gypsy heart. Anya - The spirit of freedom. Anya - Oh Anya. The light of freedom buried. Deep within your soul. Across the Puszta plain to see. The rhapsody of angels. Refuse to dance alone. What do they mean. What do they mean. Your jewel flashing. Across the dark. Forbidding distance. I love your gypsy heart. Your gypsy heart. Anya
3534,Deep Purple,Rock,I read in the news. That the average man. Is uplifted five times a day. I'm confused. I have to confess. My feeling never goes away. I know it's right. They asked the average man. In a survey across the nation. I can't understand how the average man. Keeps losing his concentration. Oh you gotta use it. Oh you gonna lose it. I'm just begun. When you're all done. I see you running down the road. Can't hear a thing. My mind is blasted. And my head is about to explode. Feeling the pain. Just more of the same. As we're rolling through the night. Going so fast. We're sure to nit the next town Before the last one's out of sight. Oh you gotta use it. Oh you gonna lose it. Back to back. One on one. Shake it up. Move it on. Back to back. One on one. Turn it up. Hold it down

3536,Deep Purple,Rock,Oh the beggar on his cornerstone. Catches pity in his wrinkled hand. But the lover whose bird has flown. Catches nothing only grains of sand. All the children in the distant house. They have feelings only children know. But the lover whose bird has flown. Catches nothing only flakes of snow. The sensation is not new to you. It's something we all have known. You get it - it goes right through you. Yes it's something we all have known. And the bird it has flown. To a place on it's own. Somewhere all alone. Now the hermit in his lonely cave. Has himself to keep him company. But the lover whose bird has flown. He has heartaches same as you and me. The sensation's not new to you. It's something we all have known. You get it - it goes right through you. Yes it's something we all have known. And the bird it has flown. Now the hermit in his lonely cave. Has himself to keep him company. But the lover whose bird has flown. He has heartaches same as you and me. Oh it's started snowing
3537,Deep Purple,Rock,Alarm bells ringing clear. Break the calm before the fall. Bad news travels at the speed of flight. Good news not at all. And here we are again. Playing endless games of war. Birds of prey. Without a word of warning. We dive in to attack. Vengeful and self-righteous. We turn the blue sky black. And a wretched few escape. They'll be forever looking back. At our sacrifice. And the golden sun is rising. At the dawn of a beautiful day. In the name of all that's holy. In the name of history. In the face of life and nature. We are driven by belief. Our faith a crumbling fortress. Once perfect and sublime. Will fail again and rise again. Until the death. Until the death of time
3538,Deep Purple,Rock,Read all about it tell me. Have you heard the news. Captain bob he don't pay no dues. You know he's looking in my window. He's stepping on my toes. Don't want the truth and it goes to show. I got a joker up my sleeve. I know what to believe. It ain't right just because it's in black and. White. Find yourself a hero. Treat him like a friend. You build him up and tear him down again. It don't hold a candle hold it to the light. Check it out is it wrong or right. Is this the news of the world. It's just a pretty girl. She's all the news that's fit to print in. Black and white. Inside information taken down note by note. A silent footstep that's all she wrote. Shit that's all she wrote. No need to worry the baby's gone to bed. Dreaming dirty dreams in black and white. And read. Now i got nothing to fear. Is this the scoop of the year. Headlines on my bathroom wall. In black and white
3539,Deep Purple,Rock,(Blackmore/Gillan/Glover/Lord). operator i'm looking for a girl. you've got to help me get through. i don't know much about her. so i'm relying on you. she got rhythm but no sense of timing. she likes living but she's got no. address. operator you've got to get me out of. this mess. let me tell you about her. she ain't got a face. she ain't got a name. she ain't got a leg to stand upon. she's out of touch. but not out of mind. and i've got to see again that gypsy. child. operator this is the call of the wild. she's a hitch hiker never gets a ride. but you can bet she's on time. she's always around but so hard to. find. she causes trouble she never takes. offence. dirty mind a heart of gold. operator don't you put me on hold.
3540,Deep Purple,Rock,After all we said today. The strangest thought occurred. I feel I ought to tell you. But it's clearly quite absurd. Wouldn't it be wonderful. If you could read my mind. Imagine all the stuff. That we could leave behind. How many words you waste. Before you're understood. Or simply sow some seeds. You'd do it if you could. Let me take a moment. Of your time. Inside you mind. I know what you're thinking. But I don't know what to say. The turmoil and the conflict. You don't have to feel that way. Look into my eyes. And feel my hand upon your heart. Holding us together. Not tearing us apart. How many words we waste. To justify a crime. Compare it to an act of love. That really takes no time. Why not take a moment. Of your time. Inside your mind

3544,Deep Purple,Rock,(Bolin/Coverdale). If you fool around. With the dealer. Remember soon. You'll have to pay. He'll creep behind you. Like a hunter. Just to steal your soul away. I don't want no one. Messing with my woman. But just the same. I don't see nobody. Fooling with you. If you're snowblind. Madonna can hold you. But if you don't understand. There is nothing she can do for you. Running from the dealer. Trying to save your soul. I can feel the fire. Coming from inside you. I know what it's like. Cos I've been burned before. Ain't no mercy. In the hunger but. You're a fool to yourself. Cos your dealer keeps you begging for more. Running from the dealer. Trying to save your soul. In the beginning all you wanted. Was the calm before the storm. If the bluebird plays the eagle. He finds his song will turn to stone. Dealer.... .
3545,Deep Purple,Rock,(Bolin/Coverdale). I was born a rambling man. An' I never got the chance. To settle down an' get a hold on love. Takin' air an' movin' around. Is all I can see that I'm doin'. An' it is bringin' me down. Drivin' on a highway going nowhere. Desolation destination. Guess I'll find it somewhere. I know if there's trouble. I ain't takin' the blame. That's why I keep movin'. So nobody knows my name. Born a loser. I'm beyond the law. Women behind me. Never can find me. They can never get together. What I've been here for. Cos I'm a drifter. Rollin' on. Ain't wastin' my time no more. .

3549,Deep Purple,Rock,Just to remind you there are other ways of turning on.. Spread the word around. The rat is leaving town. The message is a song. The misery is gone. Once I had a dream. To sing before the queen. She didn't want to know. She wouldn't see the show. What a fright. I couldn't do it right. Oh what a night. Mystic demons fly. All about the sky. With memories of a clown. The saddest show in town. When I was seventeen. Me mother said to me. Be careful what you touch. You shouldn't take so much. I blew my mind. She was so kind. I could have cried. In my mind. I had to fin. A kind of new way. Of being oh so cool. Like a blue blooded. Well studded. English fool. Speak about the past. Times are changing fast. Once I was so weak. I couldn't even speak. Shaking put a curse. Nothing could be worse. Walking through the door. Who could ask for more. Now I'm free. And I can see. That I am me. Spread the word around. The rat is leaving town. The message is a song. The misery is gone. Shaking out a curse. Nothing could be worse. Walking through the door. Who could ask for more. Now I'm free. And I can see. That I am me. Please stay away
3550,Deep Purple,Rock,I'm crying I'm dying. I can see what's wrong with me. It's in my head. I can see what's gonna be. As I lie in my bed. Man is not my brotherhood. I am of the dead. I died as I lived as I loved and was born. On some distant hill. The reasons to hide were the reasons I cried. Fools pass laughing still. There can be bad blood in all I can see. It's in my brain. You don't know the pain I feel. As I must live again. Rocks and stones can't bruise my soul but. Tears will leave a stain. They smile to themselves as they lay down my head. On some distant hill. The blind and the child sweep a tear from their eye. Fools smile as they kill. I got my own way to go and now I want. To take your minds. I believe if you could see. The blood between the lines. I believe that you could be. A better kind. Please lead the way so the unborn can play. On some greener hill. Laugh as the flames eat their burning remains. Fools die laughing still.
3551,Deep Purple,Rock,(Bolin/Hughes). When night time comes. And I'm ten thousand miles away. Just lose yourself. And watch the band kick back and play. Get up - keep in line. It's gettin' tighter all the time. You say you're feelin' fine. It's gettin' tighter all the time. Get a load off your mind. This place is right. It's hard to find. The mood is set alright. It's gonna be a long long night. You keep spinnin' 'round. You find it hard to touch the ground. And time is all it takes. You'll find it easy once you make. Get up - keep in line. It's gettin' tighter all the time. Gettin' tighter. Gettin' tighter. .
3552,Deep Purple,Rock,I'm in a bad spot babe. I can't hear what you say. I'd love to stop and talk. You keep fading away. Just the way she said it. Something in her tone. Always so convincing. But she's good on the phone. I'll wait until she's ready. That could be a while. She always takes her time. Then she turns up in style. Something not right. Didn't recognise the car. Women being what they are. There is no sense of reason. In a reasonable world. Makes any sense at all. To a reasonable girl. She said you know what I mean. But I couldn't understand. Didn't know what she said. I'm a reasonable man. It wasn't meant that way. I was only having fun. She looked me in the eye. But the damage was done. I got the vague impression. She was under my thumb. I looked the other way. And I had to succumb. Girls like that. I want girls like that. Girls like that. I like girls like that

3556,Deep Purple,Rock,I hear the beating of your wings. As if you're playing on my strings. In mysterious ways. You draw me in. To a love. Beyond all understanting. Beyond my reach. So far away. But it seems. Like only yesterday. I'm haunted. Haunted. Is that what you wanted. All that's left. Is the ghost of your smile. It stays awhile. Then fades away. I hear your footsteps on the ground. Tempting me to turn around. It's just the echo. Of a disenchanted lover. Shuffling aimlessly. Homeward bound. To empty rooms. And picture frames. And friends. Who can't recall our names. I'm haunted. Haunted. Is that what you wanted. All that's left. Is the ghost of your smile. It stays a while. And fades away
3557,Deep Purple,Rock,(Blackmore/Coverdale/Hughes/Lord/Paice). Well I'm a rock and roll preacher. Not a Sunday school teacher. You ain't no shady lady. But I love the way you strut your stuff.

You sure ripped the low ones off me. A Magnet brought you to me. Told me your name was Jo. You said you liked my music. And you really did enjoy the show. Now I wanna play piano. But my fingers don't agree. They're busy on you woman. And I feel your fingers workin' on me. You're a high ball shooter. You make it easy to see. High ball shooter. You sure ripped the low ones off me. It's time to leave you honey. I know you're feeling sad. Don't you cry now baby. You know that only makes me mad. I see you everywhere I go. Every town and place. I can't recall your name. But I know I won't forget your sweet face. You're a high ball shooter. You make it easy to see. High ball shooter. You sure ripped the low ones off me.

3559,Deep Purple,Rock,You can bury me up to my knees in shit. Or anything else... I don't mind a bit. You think I'm gonna drown but you're wrong. 'Cos man I got my hip boots on. Get your ass in the water and swim like me. It's the only way you're going free. If you blink an eye I'm down the road and gone. It's plain to see that I don't belong. I got my hip boots on. It's so cool. It's beautiful. Those rusty chains can't tie me down. 'Cos man I got my hip boots on. I never give it up. Tear it up. Rip it up. Can't get enough. Oh yeah.

It's beautiful. And it's so cool
3560,Deep Purple,Rock,(Coverdale/Hughes/Lord). Called to Madonna. To give me a line. She said boy what have you done. Passing your time with a holy man. Talking about the moon and sun. But I can't tell the difference. Between the fool and wise. Show me a river to follow. Away from all these lies. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been picking up my bones too long. Won't you understand. Called to the Captain. To put me ashore. For it looked like no man's land. Is this the way to follow. I cried as I shook his hand. He told me had no answer. He didn't really hold the key. I am a simple man. Was all he said to me. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me a hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand. I've been on the road so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand. Heard my mother crying. She was calling out my name. Whisper in the dark night. Saying who's to blame. The hour glass keeps turning. With not enought sand to see. I am a holy man. So don't you bother me. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been pickin' up my bones too long. Won't you understand. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand?. .
3561,Deep Purple,Rock,(Bolin/Coverdale). I keep singing the same old song. Like I did before. When you left me. You left me in darkness. I'd never known before. I was restless. A fool for your time. Waiting 'round for you to call. But now I've found me. An angel of mercy. I don't feel bad at all. Your body was honey. I tasted a lot. But let me tell you babe. I need more than you got. I want someone to hold me. An' keep me satisfied. I need love. I've got nothing to do. Ain't got nothing to say. Just live your life. The way you know. When you moved on. You took all the sweetness. Was I a fool to let you go. With the woman I forget for the moment. All the times we knew before. Tho I'm still singing. The same old love song. I don't want you knocking on my door. .

3563,Deep Purple,Rock,I threw a rock in the lake and it sank to the bottom. The waves spread out but the rock got forgotten. The ripples came back just as we feared. Looking for the rock but the hole disappeared. It's somewhere in the middle some way down. The last guy that went looking almost certainly drowned. He ran out of time. He can kiss tomorrow goodbye. Yes I piss in the water and burn down trees. I watch as the creatures fall to their knees. They ain't got a clue as disaster looms. They're too busy choking on toxic fumes. They got no hope and there's no point running. No matter what they do I keep on coming. They ran out of time. They can kiss tomorrow goodbye. I did a bad thing. I did a bad thing. I did a bad thing. I did a bad thing. Well hallelujah and holy mackerel. All we got left is a thief and a jackal. The writing is big and it's there on the wall. Oh how the mighty empires fall. There's nothing to fix it's much too late. Sit down and prepare to meet your fate. You have run out of time. Kiss tomorrow goodbye
3564,Deep Purple,Rock,Sweet Lucy was a dancer. But none of us would chance her. Because she was a Samurai. She made electric shadows. Beyond our fingertips. And none of us could reach that high. She came on like a teaser. I had to touch and please her. Enjoy a little paradise. The log was in my pocket. When Lucy met the Rockett. And she never knew the reason why. I can't deny it. With that smile on her face. It's not the kill. It's the thrill of the chase. Feel it coming. It's knocking at the door. You know it's no good running. It's not against the law. The point of no return. And now you know the score. And now you're learning. What's knockin' at your back door. Sweet Nancy was so fancy. To get into her pantry. Had to be the aristocracy. The members that she toyed with. At her city club. Were something in diplomacy. So we put her on the hit list. Of a common cunning linguist. A master of many tongues. And now she eases gently. From her Austin to her Bentley. Suddenly she feels so young
3565,Deep Purple,Rock,Get outta my way. I'm gettin' tired of you. There ain't no chance. Doin' what you wanna do. I've been down down down down down. Got to get my feet back on the ground. Lady double dealer. Get outta my way. Lady double dealer. You got nothing to say. I ain't satisfied. Dealin' with second hand goods. You wanted somethin' for nothin'. Taking everything you could. You been 'round--I got the news. But you ain't waitin' 'round for me to lose. Lady double dealer. Get outta my way. Lady double dealer. You got nothing to say. I gave love to you. Did what you wanted me to. But all you did was bring me down. So I just had to try. Try to reason why. You took advantage of my love. Two timin' woman. Tryin' to take me for a ride. You're a hard lover honey. But you sure don't keep me satisfied. I wanna be there. To try to make you see. There ain't no woman gonna make a fool outta me.
3566,Deep Purple,Rock,(Cook/Coverdale). She was a juke-box dancer. A blue eyed gypsy queen. She always had an answer. For what she'd done. And where she'd been. A feathercane Lady Midnight. For all around to see. She spoke with words of wisdom. And this is what she said to me. Lady luck. C'mon give me what I want. Pull me up. Lady luck. If I see you again. I will call you my friend. I have always been a sinner. But then the lady came along. She stole my heart and turned me 'round. 'Till I didn't know right from wrong. She whispered words of kindness. I'd never ever heard before. Golden words and silver tongue. Till I really couldn't take no more. Lady luck. C'mon give me what I want. Pull me up. Lady luck. If I see you again. I will call you my friend. C'mon shake me. .
3567,Deep Purple,Rock,You're lazy just stay in bed. You're lazy just stay in bed. You don't want no money. You don't want no bread. If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw. If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw. You don't want to live you don't want to cry no more. Well my trying ain't done no good. I said my trying ain't done no good. You don't make no effort no not like you should. Lazy you just stay in bed. Lazy you just stay in bed. You don't want no money. You don't want no bread
3568,Deep Purple,Rock,My shoes are heavy. My feet are winding down. I look for her in comers. But she's not around. What I eat is eating me. It hits me hard. I'm one jack short of a royal flush. A stranger holds the card. Here come the salvation in the shape of my guitar. And I'm gonna ride it like a shooting star. I don't want your money. I don't want your soul. I don't need a reason. I just want to get right down and lick it up. Mother Mercy told me. A picture never lies. She told me no self respecting hero. Ever cries. The prisoner walks in circles. The victim walks alone. Scissors cut the paper. The paper wraps the stone. Standing at the entrance to the gates of paradise. The lights go down the heat goes up that's when I cry. I don't want your money. I don't want your soul. I don't a reason. I just want to get right down and lick it up. I put my faith in fortune reaching for the sky. The only game in town that gets me high. I don't want your money. I just want to get right down and lick it up. I don't want your soul. I just want to get right down and lick it up. I don't need a reason. I just want to get right down and lick it up.
3569,Deep Purple,Rock,It takes all sorts - support your local groupie.. You came along for a weekend. But you only stayed for one night. You took out your hair. You pulled off your teeth. Oh I almost died of fright. You'd better do something for your own sake. Yes it's a shame. Ah you know you're a living wreck. You said you were a virgin. Full of promise and mystery. But I know that you. Would bring me down. 'Cos everyone calls you big G. You'd better do something for your own sake. Yes it's a shame. Ah you know you're a living wreck
3570,Deep Purple,Rock,Feels like the end. When you're closer to losing your dreams. Than losing a friend. Flying blind. I'm shooting into the dark. Who will I find. Oh girl. And if it takes me a lifetime. I swear I'll tear down every wall. Love conquers all. On my way. Tomorrow I rise with the sun. Soon I'll be gone. Words can't say. How the memories of feelings of love. They linger on. Oh girl. And if it takes me forever. I know it's worth every teardrop that falls. Love conquers all. Somewhere there's a place in your heart. Where the wounds never heal. Well you're not alone. That's just how I feel. Love conquers all. This one will last a lifetime. And if love conquers all. This one will last forever

3572,Deep Purple,Rock,(Blackmore/Glover/Gillan). She came home last night. rotten rolling drunk. She talk no sense but she sound good. so she think. So I reached over and said Hello. Is there some planet you'd care to go. And she said Venus on the rocks. She got a mean streak. Black Mamba don't compete. She got a mean streak. Temptation bitter sweet. She drives me crazy gets inside my brain. She spend my money down a drain. So I roll over for my reward. How much can I afford. And she says. Just a little more. I can't take this no more. I tried so hard but I can't get thru' the. door. Because one smile from those eyes. And I stand there paralysed. And she says. Beg for more get down sucka you know. what I like. oh hang on.

3574,Deep Purple,Rock,I got my feelers out. Pleasure I can give you pain. I'm the demon of misfortune. Let me tell you that bad luck is my game. Fires burning make you cold. You can touch but you can't hold. It's an even split. Between zip and the number on your ticket. Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt. I'm a nasty piece of work. Down get down on your knees. Running gonna bring you down. I'm the demon of disorder. You know I'm gonna drive you into the ground. As you're stepping through the door. My shadow crawls across your floor. Your dream of love. It's not enough it's gonna come to nothing. You ain't seen nothing it's gonna get worse. I'm a nasty nasty. It's an even split. Between zip and the number on your ticket. Your dream of love. It's not enough it's gonna come to nothing. Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt. You ain't seen nothing it's gonna get worse. I'm a nasty piece of work.
3575,Deep Purple,Rock,Somebody Somebody. Come to my side. I'm tired I'm crying. I'm sick inside. My woman that woman. Just wasn't right. CHORUS. Help me now please my friend. I never felt so bad before. Never never before. So funny so funny. Just like a show. One name two people. All in a row. Somebody Somebody. Someone must go. Chorus. I was hurt when I was younger. By a woman who was cold. She took my name. She took my body. And she threw away my soul. Can't hide I can't hide my misery. I know my sorrow won't set me free. She did it d'you see she did it to me. Help me now please my friend. I never felt so bad before. Never never before
3576,Deep Purple,Rock,Really hate the running really hate the game. Looking at them all I wanna be unborn again. Their suit is getting tighter although they're getting thin. The flies are crawling on their face and trying to get in. People say that we're to blame I say. No no no it's just the game. Must we let them fool us no no no. Have we got our freedom no no no. Is it getting better no no no. Do we love each other no no no. Must we wait forever no no no. Heads are getting stronger bodies getting weak. Looking at them all it feels good to be a freak. Their hands are getting closer they're reaching out so far. The greenies gonna get them make them serve stars. Tell them how it is and they say. No no no we know it all. The washing's getting dirty the air is getting thin. It's all in such a mess that no one knows where to begin. They talk about creating but all they do is kill. They say we're gonna mend it but they never will. Poison in the rain but they say. No no no we ain't to blame.
3577,Deep Purple,Rock,Maybe it's because I'm only starting. That I think it won't take too long. Maybe it's because I can see you laughing. That I think you've got it wrong. Maybe I could be like Robin Hood. Like and outlaw dressed all in green. Someone said what's he gonna turn out like. And someone else said never mind. Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old. As all the cats I'd ever seen. I grew my hair and bought a suit. Of shiny white or was it cream. I shook and shivered danced and quivered. And stood on a mountain top. No one came from miles around and said. Man your music is really hot. Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak. My throat was tired and worn. My pretty face just looked out of place. As they poured on the scorn. I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king. He said my boy we'll have some crazy scenes. There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about. He must've been the king of queens. Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done. But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung. There's a law for the rich and one for the poor. and there's another one for singers. It's die young and live much longer. Spend your money and sit and wonder. No one came for miles around. And said man your music is really funky. I believe that I must tell the truth. And say things as they really are. But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth. Could I ever be a star. Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'. Everyone's shouting out loud. It's only the glitter and shine that gets through. Where's my Robin Hood outfit. Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye. No one ever cared enought to say goodbye. The money's good and the time you have. Fun and games galore. But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten. And you wonder what you did it for. No one came from miles around. And said man who's he?.
3578,Deep Purple,Rock,(Blackmore/Glover/Gillan/Lord/Paice). Nothing I can do about it. Maybe I won't even try. Your will is determined to kill any. Reason of mine. I see you coming. With that look in your eye. You act like a king but you ain't got a. thing. In your mind. And now there's nobody home. My belly is aching. Your image is blown. Your lights are burning bright. But Nobody's Home. You talk about love and affection. If only you could. You're full of pride but there's nothing. inside. And you think you're so good. You know you got it coming to ya. All things return. You need me. It's not gonna be my concern. And now there's nobody home. Your message is changing. The children have grown. Your lights are burning bright. But nobody's home. I hear you crying. What can I say. You get what you give so. Forgive me as I turn away. Nobody's home. A legend is dying. The seeds have been sown. Your lights are burning bright. But Nobody's Home.
3579,Deep Purple,Rock,You think by leaving me the sun will go away. You think that if you go there'll be no other way. But your leaving now won't even spoil my day. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. You keep a-waiting for the tears I'm supposed to cry. The promise leaves so I'm supposed to die. I'd forgotten who you were until you dropped on by. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. You think I'm guilty throwing off the likes of you. That there'll be no one else but there'll be quite a few. At least I've got my head but somehow I'll pull through. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no
3580,Deep Purple,Rock,Cold beer and a strange cigarette. Getting you high getting you wet. Falling in love falling out of debt. Straight gay black or white. Strutting in the dark hiding in the light. Doing it wrong doing it right just doing it. You got your life on the one hand. Mine in the other. I got the right we all got the right. One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck. One man's meat is someone's empty well. One man's meat is some guy's aching butt. One man's meat is another man's living hell. Short fat thick or thin. Take it in the gut take it on the chin. Living in glory living in sin. Hard day's work going down slow. Riding the road where the greengrass grows. Watching in die what d'you know. Watch it. You got your life on the one hand. Mine in the other. I got the right. One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck. One man's meat is someone's empty well. One man's meat is some guy's aching butt. One man's meat is another man's living hell.
3581,Deep Purple,Rock,The world around us hangs in doubt. You face a crime that we'll hear about. To pay the cost would never be the same. Eternal lovers we're not to blame. There's no mistake there's no refrain. The same surroundings that stood. Are here again this time. As I look around you can't be found. To lose you I'd rather see. The endless time of space go passing by. This time around. This time around. So look around we all will be found. In love. The world around us hangs in doubt. You face a crime that we'll hear about.

3583,Deep Purple,Rock,Somebody's shouting. Up at a mountain. Only my own words return. Nobody's up there. It's a deception. When will I ever learn?. CHORUS:. I'm alone here. With emptiness eagles and snow. Unfriendliness chilling my body. And whispering pictures of home. Wondering blindly. How can they find me. Maybe they don't even know. My body is shaking. Anticipating. The call of the black footed crow.... Chorus. I'm alone here. With emptiness eagles and snow. Unfriendliness chilling my body. And whispering pictures of home. Here in this prison. Of my own making. Year after day I have grown. Into a hero. But there's no worship. Where have they hidden my thrown.... Chorus. I'm alone here. With emptiness eagles and snow. Unfriendliness chilling my body. And whispering pictures of home

3585,Deep Purple,Rock,:: Solo de Gaita ::. Put your money down. Take your choice. That’s the way it is. Every time with these boys. And you sense no shame. And you feel no disgrace. Somebody wins. Somebody loses. It’s a dirty dirty race. Oh my life. It’s a dog’s life. One empty monday. Out of the blue. Took a good luck turn. Started something new. Out of the gutter. Out of the rain. Out of my head. And I’m feeling no pain. Oh my life/feeling no pain. Take the strain. It’s a dog’s life. Ducking in the shadows. Diving in the dark. Rolling with the punches. Striking at the heart. Touching all the sense’s. Breaking those taboos. Bursting at the seams. Blowing all my fuses. The turning of a page. The burning of a book. (if you’re) talking out of turn. (it’s) just the way you look. When the time is right. But the shape is wrong. And you find yourself. Where you don’t belong. Back to reality. Back on the line. Back into this and you’ll feel no pain. You wanna do it one more time. We can do it once again. Oh my life. It’s a dog’s life. By Manta
3586,Deep Purple,Rock,My clothes don't fit and I have no point of view. I got a bad reputation but I don't believe it's true. I had something going but I blew it down the can. Not exactly what I planned. I'm a ramshackle man. That's what I am. I look like a joker but I feel like a one eyed jack. Shuffling around never get to the top of the park. I said to the dealer put the ace in my hand. But he couldn't give a damn. I'm a ramshackle man. That's what I am. I sit down thinking bout the things I have to do. I start out fine then I pick up something new. Stumbled through the door that's how it all began. Now it's buried in the sand. I'm a ramshackle man. That's what I am. The stars shine bright when the boys come out to play. Never feeling more than I'm feeling right here today. I used to be fresh but now I'm second hand. I do what I can. I'm a ramshackle man. That's what I am.
3587,Deep Purple,Rock,I don't have the time of day. I don't know what day I is. Someone's falling on my head. Get upå˜et up. We're going out on the raz. Razzle dazzle. Call it what you want. To me it don't matter. It's where I belong. It's a matter of distinction. A real fine line. Between an orgy of destruction. And a wonderful time. This room's so cold and bare. There's nothing here for me. I've got to find some heat somewhere. Get upå˜et up. We're going out on the raz. Razzle dazzle. Call it what you want. It really doesn't matter. When I'm bangin' on a gong. While someone's holding out. To a willing congregation. And we can all forget about. The state of the nation. Can't hear a thing. But I see your lips are moving. I'm working on my thinking. And I think it's improving. I'm going to get the blame. So I might as well deliver. If only I can swim across. This weird human river. I know I started out. With the best of intentions. Some blinding inspiration. And a few not-to-mention. And now I'm looking deep. Into the last dying embers. Shouting what are we doing here. And nobody remembers. I've lost a friend or two. I don't know where they have gone. Only one thing I can do. Get upå˜et up. I'm going out on the raz. Razzle dazzle. Call it what you want. To me it don't matter. It's where I belong. It's a matter of distinction. A real fine line. Between an orgy of destruction. And a wonderful time.
3588,Deep Purple,Rock,Going to Rosa's Cantina. Going to Rosa's Cantina. Hoping that she's still there. Going to Rosa's Cantina. Might have been. the dust in my eyes. the dust in my eyes. Could have been the neon cactus. Lighting up the desert sky. Must have been. the dust in my eyes. Some would call it suicide. Some would call it suicide. I would call it paradise. Some would call it suicide. Dancing on the table. Dancing on the table. Dancing on the table. when she's. drunker than she's able. Dancing on the table. Some would call it suicide. I would call it paradise. Some would call it suicide. Hell on earth. Is she right is she wrong. Will she sing another song. Wicked as it seems. right now. Rosa wants her baby back. Rosa wants her baby back. Since he's gone she's losing track. Rosa wants her baby back. Careful with that cadillac. Careful with that cadillac. Careful with that cadillac.
3589,Deep Purple,Rock,How can I see. When the light is gone out. How can I hear. When you speak so silently. More than enough. Is never too much. Hold out a hand. I'm so out of touch. Do unto me. As your heart would have you do. Looks on my head. Cannot get the message through. Sword in my hand. Can cut through the wood. Peace in my heart. Can summon the mood. What shall I do. When they stand smiling at me. Look at the floor. And be oh so cool. Oh so cool. How shall I know. When to start singing my song. What shall I do. If they all go wrong. What shall I do.
3590,Deep Purple,Rock,I'm just passing time before the ball. playing my guitar. I don't have to be where I don't want to be at all. maybe I'll go far. going nowhere sitting in a dream.... ......in a dream. Sitting in a landscape full of sighs. dream away the day. making up a tune about the blueness of the skies. this is where I'll stay. going nowhere sitting in a dream.... ......in a dream. Watching as a red and white balloon. sails across my mind. in between the images that drift along my tune. smile as they unwind. going nowhere sitting in a dream.... ......in a dream
3591,Deep Purple,Rock,Door. Don't close the door. I want to feel the cold. I want to see the light. Momma where you gone. This is no dream. Can't make it right if it's wrong. Dancing with strangers. Fighting with friends. It's a matter of time between love and despair. Falling over the line. Empty hearts and icy stares. Call me Solitaire. The eyes. In the face on the wall. Follow me round the room. Follow me everywhere. A heart without an echo. A man without a child. Alone with all my sorrow. Dancing with strangers. Fighting with friends. It's a matter of time between love and despair. Falling over the line. Empty hearts and icy stares. Call me Solitaire
3592,Deep Purple,Rock,Remind me to tell you. bout the old silver miner. name of hard rock Pete. had his house built on a slope. They say one of his legs. lived in Calico. Ther's a rumour going round. that the other lived in hope. So I walked in the room. and I stopped. I turned around. and looked over my shoulder. And a voice close beside me said. You'd better watch your head. the party's over. It wasn't long before. the waitress came over and said. Can I freshen up your drink. and have you heard of these boys. and if you feel included. to buy some cowboy boots. Well it's not that bad. we can talk above the noise. So I sucked on my beer. Shut my eyes. and tried to listen to the words. I know I missed the meaning. but the message. was something I'd already heard. Johnny Ringo's voice. is getting deeper. and now he's going to put. another lock on the door. The night is getting later. My head is getting lighter. The mood is getting darker. Tequila's being poured. So I smile. at the old gunslinger. in his frame on the wall. as he pushed back his hat. And it's all coming back. I'd cut a long story short. but it's much too late for that. Somebody stole my guitar. They took it from. the back seat of my car. I was sleeping in Memphis. in my hotel room. and somebody stole my guitar.
3593,Deep Purple,Rock,While you were out.... The message says. You left a number. And I tried to call. But they wrote it down. In a perfect spanish scrawl. In a perfect spanish scrawl. Yet again. I'm missing you. King size bed. (in a) hotel someplace. I hear your name. I see your face. I see your face. (the) back street dolls. And the side door johnnies. The wide eyed boys with their bags full of. Money. Back in the alley. Going bang to the wall. Tied to the tail. Of a midnight crawl. Heaven wouldn't be. So high I know. If the times gone by. Hadn't been so low. The best laid plans. Come apart at the seams. And shatter all my dreams. Sometimes I feel like.... Screaming. Close my eyes. It's times like this. My head goes down. And the only thing I know. Is the name of this town. Is the name of this town. Yet again. I'm missing you. Won't be long. I'm coming home. Until that distant time. I'll be moving on. I'll be moving on

3598,Deep Purple,Rock,Been so many words so much to say. Words are not enough to keep the guns at bay. Some live in fear some do not. Some gamble everything on who gets the final shot. Oh don't talk to me of love. It's obvious it's not enough. Annihilation kill them all. Capitulation watch the mighty fall. The road to glory is lined in red. And though the reason now is gone. The battle rages on. Was it love or hate that got here first. Hate's a habit it's hard to shake the curse. Kill to live and live to die. Human nature you let the strong survive. Oh don't talk to me of love. Be serious it's not enough. Annihilation kill them all. Capitulation watch the mighty fall. The road to glory is lined in red. And trough the reason now is gone. The battle rages on.
3599,Deep Purple,Rock,No one sees the things you do. Because I stand in front of you. But you drive me all the time. Put the evil in my mind. Used to sing and say my prayers. Live my life without a care. Now I have become a fool. Because I listened to the mule. How can I change when my mind is a friend. of a Lucifer hid in the ground. Just another slave for the mule.
3600,Deep Purple,Rock,Painter. Come colour up my life. Oh painter. Come colour up my life. Take away the misery. Take away the strife. Writer. Make me up a play. Writer. Make the meaning gay.

3601,Deep Purple,Rock,(Blackmore/Gillan/Glover). well there must have been a reason for the smile that you had upon your. face last night. are you the cat that got the cream did you lick your lips did you close. your eyes. can you imagine how it feels it's so hard to reveal. oh i can't get through and i'm falling. i'm getting out i'm losing ground. the spanish archer's gonna bring you down. is there someone somewhere waiting in the wings to take my place. let's not drag it out like a cagney death scene. in this season of change it's not hard to explain. like the leaves on the trees i'm falling. and as you turn don't look away. the spanish archer's gonna make you pay. do you remember when the sky was blue we used to talk for miles. and now we drive along in this thundering silence. it's such an obvious lie with that easy smile of yours. i'm letting go and i'm falling. i'm getting out losing ground. the spanish archer's gonna bring you down. well is there something i can say as we stumble to the edge have we gone. too far. why don't we call it a day before we call it a nightmare darlin'. if we made a mistake then all that it takes to be free. is the wave of a hand and you're falling and as you turn don't look away. the spanish archer's gonna make you pay.
3602,Deep Purple,Rock,(Blackmore/Gillan/Glover/Paice). listen to. me. i've got a. warning for. you. you've got to. learn to take. more care. 'cos if you swim in. dirty water. be careful how you dry. your hair. in a room within a room. in a hole within a hole. you've got to learn to share. your secrets. or you'll lose your soul. i've got the evidence. i know you broke the unwritten law. another town another one night stand. you know you broke the law. it's so hard to hold back. when the fire is in your eyes. a silver dollar in my pocket. i don't like surprises. i've got your souvenir. is that the price i've got to pay. it ain't been that long. since the last charade. i know you're guilty. but i'm carrying the blame. i took out much more than i put in. and i felt the pain. in a dirty little room. with nowhere left to hide. you told the truth with your eyes. but you lied inside.

3605,Deep Purple,Rock,Consider your position position your defense. Why don't you let me ask you is it mere coincidence. Feeding speculators on a downhill gravy train. Like vultures ripping out the eyes to reach the dying brain. Listen to the wind - a silent scream. Tearing at your broken heart. Like a forgotten dream. And there's a time for peace a time for war. Wondering what we've been put here for. A time for giving a time to take. A time for love and a time for hate. A time for beg and a time to steal. So you gamble on that spinning wheel. Of all these things I've had my fill. Lord I need some time to kill. Ten percent of nothing is exactly what you got. You thing you've got the given right to take another shot. I'll take away your money all you've got is coloured beads. Find a piece of land where you can sow your seeds. Listen to the wind - a silent scream. Tearing at your broken heart. Like a forgotten dream. There's a time for passion a time for pain. A time to learn that we're all the same. A time to remember a time to forget. Wondering how we're going to pay our debts. A time for thunder a time for rain. Waiting for the seasons to change. Of all these things I've had my fill. Lord I need some time to kill.

Learn to fight. Who could care if it's wrong or if it's right. We got no choice. Under command. We're ordered to die or take this land. Stupid bastards and religious freaks. So safe in their castle keeps. They turn away as a mother weeps. Under the gun. When brave men fall. Under crimson skies. There's a sadness reflected in a soldier's. eyes. Tears will dry. For those I kill. Remember no more their names but. someone will. The only way to be victorious. Screw the fools who think it's glorious. Who gives a toss about the likes of us. Under the gun.
3607,Deep Purple,Rock,If you don't like what you see. If you can do better than me. You better walk on. If the road before you winds. Obscuring all the signs. You better walk on. You mean more to me. Than just a pretty face. I wont hold you down. You need a little space. If you don't like what you see. If you can do better than me. You better walk on. You know I don't like to fight. No matter who's wrong or right. You better walk on. I don´t mean to bring you down. If you prefer the other side of town. Walk On. You been troubled. Sleeping through the night. Deal with it in the daytime. Then you can turn off the light. If you don´t like what you see. If you can do better than me. You better walk on. Girl I tried. You know I tried. And while I cried. You lied. You better walk on. Well the heart inside me burns. And the world around me turns. You better walk on. You know It won't be right away. We'll meet again someday. You better walk on. You better walk on. When the shine wears off. And he's on to something new. Try not to think about. How good I was to you. If you don't like what you see. If you can do better than me. You better Walk on
3608,Deep Purple,Rock,(Lennon/McCartney). Try to see it my way. Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go wrong. While you see it your way. Run the risk of knowing that our love will soon be gone.

We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight. We can work it out. We can work it out. Life is very short and there's no time. For fussing and fighting my friend. I have always thought that it's a crime. So I will ask you once again. I'll ask you once again. Try to see it my way. Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. While I see it your way. There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long. We can work it out. We can work it out. Life is very short and there's no time. For fussing and fighting my friend.

3609,Demon Hunter,Rock,Tell me your misery. Give us the antidote. I heard the voice of change. Behind a vacant note. All this tearing apart. Without a reform. Call it what you will. I'm not afraid to say. I've heard it all. Connection lost. We're standing by. Artificial light. You sell a fix. For our defect. And all we find. Artificial light. Doesn't break the model. I can't feel it in my bones. Nothing shattering my world. No. We want a real cure. Not idle sympahty. The dark consuming light. That you have failed to be. No. It's not enough. I resent this deprivation. Your remedy. Is not a weapon. To slaughter the sorrow. It's just to keep you from feeling alone. I've heard it all. Connection lost. We're standing by. Artificial light. You sell a fix. For our defect. And all we find. Artificial light. Doesn't break the model. I can't feel it in my bones. Nothing shattering my world. No. I'll never see. What they see in you. Doesn't break the model. I can't feel it in my bones. Nothing shattering my world. No
3610,Demon Hunter,Rock,In the never-ending circle where. The powerless meet. There grows a struggle from the burden. Of sustaining defeat. In the face of every coward lies the. Blindest of hate. And in the eyes a sharpened image of. The damage they made. You look at me to bear the burden of the suffering past. It wasn't me behind the veil. Of a heartless mask. And where were you the day that everybody. Cursed your name?. You were the distant voice of pride. That never stood the shame.. The weak of the mind will use fist. And the fist of the frail will bring gun. The loudest of guns provoke bombs. And in wrath he will chase until it's done.. CHORUS:. Your history is dead.. Dead wrong.. Dead - dead wrong.. Philosophy is dead.. Dead wrong.. Dead - dead wrong.. Within the mind of modern culture. There's an idle cog. It is the section of humanity that never forgot. And in the midst of moving forward we have given the right. To let the wolves attack the sheep and bury guilt inside. I won't forget the twisted picture of the filth that we were. Or disregard the fading voices of the people we hurt. But I was never pulling triggers or degrading your face.. Don't look at me to give the reason for the pain that you trace.. (CHORUS). The scars outlive the pain.. Reflections will remain.. The scars outlive the pain.. Your sickness will remain.. Dead - dead wrong.
3611,Demon Hunter,Rock,I see the weight of hollow death residing in you. Take now your final breath. Exhale the truth. I see the fear of nothing left. Dead fragments of youth. You hold it in yourself. I feel it too. I mourn your blindness. I die along. And swallow darkness. In misery is where I belong. Collapsing in on yourself. I don't know why I try. Collapsing in on yourself. I don't know why you deny. I know the light is burning dim and dying in you. I know the pain that lies within. I feel it too. No vow of silence. No remission of truth
3612,Demon Hunter,Rock,I'm not your gateway. I'm not your prodigal son. I am the vile lesser-than. Just who do you think I am?. I'm not your standard. I'm not your vision divine. I am no sacrificial lamb. Just who do you think I am?. I am death (x4). I'm not your sacrifice. I'm not your shelter in the storm. I am determinately man. Just who do you think I am?. I'm not your child. I'm not your paragon of just. I am by other means damned. Just who do you think I am?. I am death. Who do you think I am?
3613,Demon Hunter,Rock,I don? t wanna close my eyes. I can? t tell if I? m asleep or if I? m blind. We? re going nowhere. No one seems to care. I could sell a peace of mind. I could tell you every time that I divide. The water will decide. Where to feed me. Mother don? t you cry. Hell don? t need me. I will see it all in time. ? I can? t be the only one across that line. We? re going nowhere. No one seems to care. [Chorus]. The water will decide. Where to feed me. Mother don? t you cry. Hell don? t need me. Don? t need me [x4]. [Chorus x2]. The water will decide. Where to feed me. Mother don? t you cry. Hell don? t need me
3614,Demon Hunter,Rock,I suffocate.. Reality is tearing my life away.. All in vain.. I'm taking my pride into the grave.. What a fine line we walk with our eyes closed.. Giving our worst as first like we don't know.. Burning my way through life with a vengeance. Giving my weight in hate until the neck bends. Tearing out every trace of emotion. Falling into this cell that you've opened. Hollow as all these faces around me. Feeling your fatal infection surround me.. CHORUS:. We all live in fear of something.. We all disappear like nothing.. We all live in fear of something.. We all equal less than nothing.. I suffocate.. I'm taking my life from first to last.. All this hate is dragging my face through broken glass.. How can we be so blind in the same light?. Covering all these scars that we can't hide.. Feeling my way through thorns of rejection.. Bleeding out all this filth of infection.. (CHORUS). Nothing.. Nothing.. We're nothing.. Nothing.
3615,Demon Hunter,Rock,Instrumental
3616,Demon Hunter,Rock,Did anyone survive?. I swear I heard your voice beyond this side. Does anyone still try?. Does anyone still hope to set their eyes. Beyond this place?. Where angels fall and darkness reigns. Where time dissolves the brightest flame. Ever the same. Whether I'm the last one alive. Or ascend before my time. Better I'm the last one alive. Than a soul denied. So this is how we break. And this is where we find the only hope. Within this place. Where angels fall and darkness reigns. Where time dissolves the brightest flame. Ever the same. Whether I'm the last one alive. Or ascend before my time. Better I'm the last one alive. Than a soul denied. Whether I'm the last one alive. Or ascend before my time. Better I'm the last one alive. Than a soul denied. Whether I'm the last one alive. Or ascend before my time. Better I'm the last one alive. Than a soul denied
3617,Demon Hunter,Rock,These are trying times. Made to break the heart wide. But we still defy. We will make the dead rise. We can't be silent. We can't belong. We have a promise. To die upon. We'll set the fire. Into a song. To burn eternal. When we're all gone. These are trying times. Made to break the heart wide. But we still defy. We will make the dead rise
3618,Doctor X,Rock,Ela anda sozinha encharcando seus pés. As nuvens acompanham na borda do mar. Seus olhos brilham perdidos no nada. Sua boca entristece querendo canta. Seu sorriso é apenas mais um. Cobrindo o seu vazio. Os abutres a rodeiam querendo seu mel. Esperam ela cair das nuvens. Para nas suas asas mergulharem no céu. Pobre lady!. Aonde você vai para?. Pobre lady!. Fuja dos abutres e começa a pensa. O ar que contorna seu corpo. E faz com ela continue a andar. Enquanto os dias evaporam como a água. Ela cansa sem ter alguém para amar. Seu sorriso é apenas mais um. Cobrindo o seu vazio. Os abutres a rodeiam querendo seu mel. Esperam ela cair das nuvens. Para nas suas asas mergulharem no céu. Pobre lady!. Aonde você vai para?. Pobre lady!. Fuja dos abutres e começa a pensa

3624,Elvis Presley,Rock,(Words & music by Edwards - David). Did you ever notice when the sun goes down. Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound. It's a whistling tune for walking in the night. If you listen you can hear it in the breeze. Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees. It's a whistling tune for walking in the night. And the murmuring waters sing the song. The echoing mountains hum along. The whispering valleys fill the air. With a whistling tune our hearts can share. It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon. Listening to old mother nature's favorite tune.

And the women all were fast. There she goes my friend. She's rolling out at last. Hear the mighty engines roar. See the silver wing on high. She's away and westward bound. For above the clouds she flies. Where the mornin' rain don't fall. And the sun always shines. She'll be flying over my home. In about three hours time. This ol' airports got me down. It's no earthly good to me. 'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground. Cold and drunk as I might be. Can't jump a jet plane. Like you can a freight train. So I best be on my way. In the early mornin' rain. So I best be on my way. In the early mornin' rain. So I best be on my way

Take a look at a brand new fool. Take a look at a brand new fool.

3689,Elvis Presley,Rock,When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup. O'er hills and meadows we'd strayed. Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun. We grew up together that way. I remember the time at the old swimming hole. When I would have drowned beyond doubt. Shep was right there to the rescue he came. He jumped in and helped pull me out. So the years sped along and at last he grew old. His eye sight was fast growing dim. Then one day the doctor looked at me and said. I can't do no more for him Jim. With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun. I aimed it at Shep's faithful head. I just couldn't do it I wanted to run. And I wished they'd shoot me instead. I went to his side and I sat on the ground. He laid his head on my knees. I stroke the best pal that a man ever found. I cried so I scaresly could see. Old Shepy he knew he was going to go. for he reached out and nipped at my hand. He looked up at me just as much as to say. We're parting but you'll understand. Now old Shep is gone where the good doggies go. And no more with old Shep will I roam. But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know. Old Shep has a wonderful home

And hold your loved ones tight. For you know the Lord's been good to you. On a snowy Christmas night. Mother Nature wears a bridal gown. For the world is dressed in white. There's a silent glow that fills the earth. On a snowy Christmas night. For you know the Lord's been good to you.

If you don't it's a crime. Life's a playful puppy. You can grab by the scruff. And if you live every sec' what the heck. Once is enough. Never wait until tomorrow. What if it never comes. Life is a seven layer. Don't you settle for crumbs. Life's a playful puppy. You can grab by the scruff. And if you live every sec' what the heck. Once is enough. And if you live every sec' what the heck. Once is enough. And if you live every sec' what the heck.

These Things Are A Poor Man's Gold.. It's The Twinkle In The Eyes Of The Gray Haired Old Man We Call Grandpa.. Tellin' Tales To The Kids That Get Taller Every Time There Told.. And It's Knowin' That For A While He's No Longer Lonely.. These Things Are A Poor Man's Gold.. . It's The Smell Of Honeysuckle In The Springtime It's The Silence Of A Freshly. Fallin Snow.. It's The Sound Of Children Laughing In The Sunshine.. It's A Crisp Autum Night With A Million Stars All Aglow.. And It's The Sweet Sleepy Sound Of Your Warm Gentle Breathing.. As You Cling To Me In The Night To Keep Away The Cold.. And It's The Softness Of Your Body There In The Darkness.. These Things Are A Poor Man's Gold..
3696,Elvis Presley,Rock,Promised Land. . (Words & music by Chuck Berry). I left my home in Norfolk Virginia. California on my mind. I straddled that Greyhound. And rode into Raleigh. And on across Caroline. We had motor trouble that turn into a struggle. Halfway across Alabam'. And that hound broke down and left us all stranded. In downtown Birmingham. Right away I brought me a through train ticket. Ridin' across Mississippi clean. And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham. Smoking into New Orleans. Somebody help me get out of Louisiana. Just to help me get to Houston Town. There are people there who care a little about me. And they won't let the poor boy down. Sure as you're born brought me a silk suit. Put luggage in my hand. And I woke up high over Alburquerque. On a jet to the promised land. Working on a T-bone steak a la carte. Flying over to the golden state. Ah when the pilot told us in thirteen minutes. He would set us at the terminal gate. Swing low chariot come down easy. Taxi to the terminal zone. Cut your engines and cool your wings. And let me make it to the telephone. Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia. Tidewater four ten o nine. Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling. And the poor boy is on the line. Working on a T-bone steak a la carte. Flying over to the golden state. Ah when the pilot told us in thirteen minutes. He would set us at the terminal gate. Swing low chariot come down easy. Taxi to the terminal zone. Cut your engines and cool your wings. And let me make it to the telephone. Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia. Tidewater four ten o nine. Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
3697,Elvis Presley,Rock,I know I'd go from rags to riches. If you would only say you cared. And though my pockets may be empty. I'd be a millionaire. My clothes may still be torn and tattered. But in my heart I'd be a king. Your love is all that ever mattered. It's everything. So open your arms and you'll open the door. To all the treasure that I'm living for. Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore. Must I forever stay a beggar. Whose golden dreams will not come true. Or will I go from rags to riches. My fate is up to you.
3698,Elvis Presley,Rock,(Words & music by David Hess - Herb Goldberg). At night. When the sky is still. When the south wind blows. And the air is warm. There's a world that's born. And for every child on the beach that day. Stands a castle tall and proud. And the warm wind crawls through the castle walls. And the nightfolk wake as the warm wind calls. At night. When the sky is still. When the south wind blows. And the air is warm. There's a world that's born. Then the fiddler crab plays his violin. On the back of a dancing whale. While the mermaid sing to the shell they bring. And the dragon leads with his sweeping tail. At night. When the sky is still. When the south wind blows. And the air is warm. There's a world that's born. For the rosy dawn. Brings the children on to the beach that's bright and new. And the nightfolk know as the castles grow. They will play once more as the children do. At night. When the sky is still. When the south wind blows. And the air is warm. There's a world that's born. A world that's born. There's a world that's born.

3701,Elvis Presley,Rock,(Words & music by Rosenblatt - Milrose). I'm just a Smokey mountain boy. Come back to the hills I love. Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind. And the deep blue sky above. The closer and closer I get to home. The more excited I am. Those were the mornings I'd roll out of bed. Start the day off with a hot corn bread. Smothered in huckleberry jam. I'm just a Smokey mountain boy. Come back to the hills I love. Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind. And the deep blue sky above. I can almost hear the hounds running through the woods. Close on the trail of the hare. How I long to be with them following the hounds. a-huntin' again. Gettin' me a big old grizzly bear. I'm just a Smokey mountain boy. Come back to the hills I love. Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind. And the deep blue sky above. I traveled around and met lots of girls. No matter how many I see. I left some pretty ones behind. I know back home is where I'll find. The girl whose love is meant for me. I'm just a Smokey mountain boy. Come back to the hills I love. Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind.

Gonna live for tomorrow. Starting today.

3716,Elvis Presley,Rock,(Words & music by Stanley Kesler). I have wished for the wealth. Of a great millionaire. I have reached for a bright star above. But the thrill of it all. To me seems so small. When compared to the thrill of your love. I'd rather give everything. That I own in this world. Than to be all alone and unloved. For no earthly price and no sacrifice. Is too much to give. For your love. I'd rather give everything. That I own in this world. Than to be all alone and unloved. For no earthly price and no sacrifice. Is too much to give.
3717,Elvis Presley,Rock,(Words & music by Bob Dylan). If today was not an endless highway. If tonight was not an endless trail. If tomorrow wasn't such a long time. Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all. Yes and only if my own true love was waiting. If I could hear her heart softly pounding. If only she was lying by me. Then I'd lie in my bed once again. I can't see my reflection in the water. I can't speak the sounds that show no pain. I can't hear the echo of my footsteps. I can't remember the sound of my own name. Yes and only if my own true love was waiting. If I could hear her heart softly pounding. If only she was lying by me. Then I'd lie in my bed once again. There's beauty in the silver singing river. There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky. But none of these and nothing else could match the beauty. That I remember in my true love's eyes. Yes and only if my own true love was waiting. If I could hear her heart softly pounding. If only she was lying by me. Then I'd lie in my bed once again. If today was not an endless highway. If tonight was not an endless trail. If tomorrow wasn't such a long time. Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all. Yes and only if my own true love was waiting. If I could hear her heart softly pounding. If only she was lying by me.

3721,Elvis Presley,Rock,Living below in this old sinful world. Hardly a comfort can afford. Striving alone to face temptation so. Now won't you tell me. Where could I go but to the Lord. Where could I go oh where could I go. Seeking the refuge for my soul. Needing a friend to save me in the end. Won't you tell me. Where could I go but to the Lord.
